## **[M01-036]** Comprehensive Status Report of All Managed Projects

**Type:** Milestone Task  
**Milestone:** M01_Foundation  
**Priority:** High  
**Story Points:** 5  
**Assignee:** @claude-code  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Sprint:** S01  
**Projects Affected:** All managed projects (11 total)

**Description:**
Create a comprehensive status overview report of all managed projects in the Claude PM framework. This task involves delegating analysis to subprocesses for each managed project and aggregating the results into a unified framework-wide status report. This supports the M01 Foundation milestone by providing visibility into the current state of all framework components and identifying areas requiring attention.

**Milestone Context:**
- Provides comprehensive visibility into M01 foundation project health
- Establishes baseline for framework maturity assessment
- Enables data-driven prioritization of remaining M01 tasks
- Supports transition planning to M02 Automation milestone

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Complete status analysis of ai-code-review project
- [x] Complete status analysis of ai-power-rankings-data project  
- [x] Complete status analysis of ai-power-rankings project
- [x] Complete status analysis of claude-pm-portfolio-manager project
- [x] Complete status analysis of eva-monorepo project
- [ ] Complete status analysis of git-portfolio-manager project
- [ ] Complete status analysis of hot-flash project
- [ ] Complete status analysis of matsuoka-com project
- [ ] Complete status analysis of mem0ai project
- [ ] Complete status analysis of scraper-engine project
- [ ] Complete status analysis of py-mcp-ipc project
- [ ] Aggregate all individual reports into comprehensive framework overview
- [ ] Identify critical issues requiring immediate attention
- [ ] Document findings in TrackDown ticket for future reference

**Technical Notes:**
- Using Claude Code Task tool to delegate analysis to subprocesses
- Each subprocess analyzes CLAUDE.md, project structure, and current status
- Focus on: project type, development phase, technology stack, completion status
- Standardized reporting format for consistent aggregation
- Include recommendations for M01 completion priorities

**Cross-Project Dependencies:**
- [ ] All managed projects must have readable CLAUDE.md files
- [ ] Project documentation must be current and accurate
- [ ] TrackDown systems must be accessible for status verification

**Individual Project Analysis Status:**

### Completed Analysis (5/11):
1. **ai-code-review** ✅ - Production-ready v4.3.0, TypeScript CLI tool, 95.6% test coverage
2. **ai-power-rankings-data** ✅ - Production pipeline, 85-90% complete, 6,399 news items processed  
3. **ai-power-rankings** ✅ - Production v3.1.1, JSON-based architecture, 9 languages
4. **claude-pm-portfolio-manager** ✅ - Early development v0.1.0, React dashboard in Sprint 1
5. **eva-monorepo** ✅ - Post-migration production phase (90% complete), all services operational

### Pending Analysis (6/11):
6. **git-portfolio-manager** - Repository monitoring system
7. **hot-flash** - Music website/platform
8. **matsuoka-com** - Personal website
9. **mem0ai** - AI memory framework (forked OSS project)
10. **scraper-engine** - Intelligent web scraping platform
11. **py-mcp-ipc** - Python MCP communication infrastructure

**Testing Strategy:**
- [ ] Verify all project reports contain required information fields
- [ ] Cross-reference findings with actual project states
- [ ] Validate aggregated report completeness and accuracy
- [ ] Test TrackDown ticket integration and referencing

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] All 11 managed projects analyzed and documented
- [ ] Individual subprocess reports completed and validated
- [ ] Comprehensive aggregated report created with actionable insights
- [ ] Critical issues and priority recommendations identified
- [ ] Framework health assessment completed with M01 completion guidance
- [ ] TrackDown ticket updated with complete findings
- [ ] Report accessible for M02 Automation milestone planning

**Framework Impact:**
This comprehensive status report will provide the foundation for:
- M01 Foundation milestone completion assessment
- M02 Automation milestone planning and prioritization  
- Resource allocation decisions across the framework
- Health monitoring baseline establishment
- Cross-project integration opportunity identification
