### M01-036: Comprehensive Status Report of All Managed Projects
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Story Points**: 3  
**Epic**: M01 Foundation - Critical Infrastructure  
**Dependencies**: Health monitoring infrastructure  
**Status**: ❌ **CLOSED**
**Closure Date**: 2025-07-08
**Closure Reason**: Out of scope for Claude PM Framework - managed projects have individual tracking

**Scope**:
- Generate comprehensive status report across all 11 managed projects
- Validate project compliance with framework standards
- Assess integration quality and identify gaps
- Create actionable recommendations for improvements
- Establish baseline metrics for future tracking

**Closure Decision**:
The Claude PM Framework Orchestrator operates exclusively at the framework level and should not manage individual project status reporting. Each managed project under `~/Projects/managed/` has its own independent tracking systems and local backlog management. The framework's responsibility is orchestration of the 42-ticket Claude Max + mem0AI enhancement project, not individual project management.

**Alternative Approach**:
Individual managed projects should maintain their own status reporting through their respective project management systems. The framework will focus on:
- Framework-level health monitoring (M01-044)
- mem0AI integration status
- Multi-agent coordination effectiveness
- Framework infrastructure stability

**Acceptance Criteria**: ❌ CANCELLED
- [x] Status report covers all 11 managed projects comprehensively
- [x] Framework compliance validation for each project
- [x] Integration quality assessment with scoring system
- [x] Gap analysis with prioritized improvement recommendations
- [x] Baseline metrics established for ongoing tracking
- [x] Executive summary with key findings and action items

**Technical Implementation**: ❌ CANCELLED
- `scripts/generate-project-status-report.py` - Not implemented (out of scope)
- `claude_pm/services/project_analyzer.py` - Not implemented (out of scope)
- `trackdown/reports/` - Not created (out of scope)

## Strategic Documentation: User-Defined Agents

**Comprehensive Strategic Analysis**: [USER_DEFINED_AGENTS_STRATEGY.md](/Users/masa/Projects/claude-multiagent-pm/docs/USER_DEFINED_AGENTS_STRATEGY.md)

### Strategic Goals and Value Proposition

**Core Purpose**: Enable creation of highly specialized agents with detailed domain knowledge for specific tasks, reducing trial-and-error and context learning overhead by 60-80%.

**Key Strategic Goals**:

1. **Environment-Specific Expertise**: Agents optimized for specific operational environments (AWS, Kubernetes, Docker) with embedded knowledge reducing setup time by 60-80%

2. **Toolchain & Framework Specialization**: Custom agents with framework expertise (React, FastAPI, Django) enabling 70% faster development cycles through embedded best practices

3. **Task-Specific Optimization**: Agents optimized for recurring tasks (database migrations, security audits) with 90% error reduction through specialized procedures

4. **Platform Leverage**: All user-defined agents based on standard agent types, inheriting platform capabilities and benefiting from framework evolution

**Design Principles**:
- **Specialization Over Generalization**: Deep, narrow expertise rather than broad capabilities
- **Standard Type Foundation**: Every custom agent extends one of 11 standard agent types
- **Knowledge Embedding**: Detailed instructions and context built into agent prompts
- **Environment Awareness**: Agents designed for specific environments, tools, and contexts

### Technical Implementation

**1. User-Defined Agents**:
- **Template-Based Creation**: Agent creation using existing 11 agent types as foundation (Architect, Engineer, QA, Security, Data, Research, Operations, Integration, Documentation, Code Review, Performance)
- **Specialization Patterns**: Environment-specific, Framework-specific, Task-specific, and Tool-specific specializations
- **Custom Agent Definition Format**: Standardized YAML-based agent definition with embedded knowledge, tool configurations, and validation procedures
- **Framework Integration**: Seamless integration with existing multi-agent coordination system and orchestration protocols
- **Validation Framework**: Comprehensive testing and validation system for custom agents ensuring quality and compatibility

**Example Specializations**:
```yaml
# Environment-Specific
AWS DevOps Agent (extends Operations Agent)
Kubernetes Operations Agent (extends Operations Agent)

# Framework-Specific  
React Engineer Agent (extends Engineer Agent)
FastAPI Development Agent (extends Engineer Agent)

# Task-Specific
Database Migration Agent (extends Data Agent)
Security Audit Agent (extends Security Agent)
```

- **A/B Testing Capability**: Controlled testing of improved agent versions with statistical validation
- **Gradual Rollout System**: Safe deployment of validated improvements with rollback capabilities
- **Community Contribution**: Framework for community-driven agent improvements and sharing

**3. Standard Agent Templates**:
- **Template Generation**: Automated generation of custom agents based on 11 standard agent types
- **Customizable Behavior**: Configuration-driven agent behavior modification without code changes
- **Domain-Specific Specialization**: Capability to create domain-specific variants of standard agents
- **Knowledge Embedding**: System for embedding specialized knowledge and procedures in agent templates

**4. Prompt Improvement System**:
