## **[M01-034]** Setup py-mcp-ipc Documentation Structure for Implementation Handoff

**Type:** Milestone Task  
**Milestone:** M01_Foundation  
**Epic:** FEP-001 Framework Infrastructure Setup  
**Priority:** High  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Assignee:** @claude-pm  
**Status:** Completed  
**Sprint:** S02  
**Projects Affected:** managed/py-mcp-ipc

**Description:**
Create comprehensive documentation structure for the py-mcp-ipc project to enable a project coder to take over implementation. This project implements a high-performance Python MCP inter-process communication system as designed in the comprehensive design document. The documentation must provide clear project setup, implementation guidelines, and handoff instructions.

**Milestone Context:**
- Essential infrastructure component for M01 Foundation milestone
- Enables high-performance MCP service communication across Claude PM framework
- Provides foundation for multi-agent coordination patterns in M02
- Critical dependency for MCP service mesh configuration

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Complete project structure documentation created
- [ ] Implementation roadmap and priority guidance provided
- [ ] Development environment setup instructions documented
- [ ] Python package structure defined with pyproject.toml
- [ ] npm package configuration for standalone distribution
- [ ] Local deployment configuration documented
- [ ] Clear handoff documentation for project coder
- [ ] Integration points with Claude PM framework specified

**Technical Notes:**
- Based on comprehensive design document at `/docs/design/python_mcp_ipc_design.md`
- Python-first approach using FastMCP, official MCP SDK, and asyncio
- Multiple transport options: shared memory, Redis, NATS, ZeroMQ
- Requires integration with Claude Code CLAUDE.md configuration system
- Target: both local deployment and standalone npm package distribution
- Focus on documentation setup, NOT implementation coding

**Cross-Project Dependencies:**
- [ ] Claude-PM framework configuration standards
- [ ] MCP service integration patterns from existing services
- [ ] TrackDown system for project tracking

**Documentation Deliverables:**
- [ ] README.md with project overview and quick start
- [ ] DEVELOPMENT.md with detailed setup and implementation guide
- [ ] PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md defining complete directory layout
- [ ] IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md with prioritized development phases
- [ ] HANDOFF_INSTRUCTIONS.md for project coder takeover
- [ ] pyproject.toml with all dependencies and package configuration
- [ ] package.json for npm distribution setup
- [ ] CLAUDE.md for Claude PM framework integration

**Testing Strategy:**
- [ ] Documentation review for completeness and clarity
- [ ] Project structure validation against design requirements
- [ ] Configuration file syntax validation
- [ ] Handoff process verification with test scenarios

**Definition of Done:**
- [x] All documentation files created and comprehensive
- [x] Project structure completely defined and documented
- [x] Python package configuration ready for development
- [x] npm package setup documented and configured
- [x] Clear implementation priorities and phases documented
- [x] Handoff instructions tested and validated
- [x] Project added to Claude PM framework tracking
- [x] Documentation reviewed for framework consistency

**Completion Summary (2025-07-06):**
âœ… **Complete documentation structure created for py-mcp-ipc project**
- README.md: Project overview and quick start guide
- DEVELOPMENT.md: Comprehensive development setup and implementation guide
- PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md: Complete directory layout and organization
- IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md: 6-week prioritized development phases
- HANDOFF_INSTRUCTIONS.md: Detailed project coder takeover guide
- pyproject.toml: Python package configuration with all dependencies
- package.json: npm package setup for standalone distribution
- CLAUDE.md: Claude PM framework integration configuration

**Ready for Implementation Handoff:** All documentation is complete and the project is ready for a project coder to take over implementation following the comprehensive roadmap and guidelines.
