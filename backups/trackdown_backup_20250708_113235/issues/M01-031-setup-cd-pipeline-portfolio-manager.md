## **[M01-031]** Setup CI/CD Pipeline for Claude PM Portfolio Manager

**Type:** Milestone Task  
**Milestone:** M01_Foundation  
**Epic:** FEP-001 Framework Infrastructure Setup  
**Priority:** High  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Assignee:** @claude  
**Status:** Completed  
**Sprint:** S01  
**Projects Affected:** claude-pm-portfolio-manager

**Description:**
Set up local continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the Claude PM Portfolio Manager React application. This will enable automated testing, building, and local deployment with file watching, ensuring the dashboard is always up-to-date and running locally for Claude PM framework monitoring.

**Milestone Context:**
- Enables automated deployment of the portfolio dashboard
- Supports continuous monitoring of Claude PM framework through live dashboard
- Critical for achieving operational monitoring capabilities (Level 2)
- Aligns with S02 objectives for infrastructure deployment automation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Create local CI/CD pipeline with file watching
- [x] Configure automated testing on file changes
- [x] Set up automated build process for local deployment
- [x] Deploy locally with auto-reload capabilities
- [x] Ensure dashboard updates automatically when files change
- [x] Configure local environment and data sources
- [x] Add local deployment scripts and documentation

**Technical Notes:**
- Use npm scripts and file watchers for local CI/CD
- Deploy locally with Vite dev server and auto-reload
- Configure file watching for source code and data changes
- Set up local health monitoring and restart capabilities
- Ensure TypeScript checking and Biome linting run automatically

**Cross-Project Dependencies:**
- [ ] Integrates with existing git repository structure
- [ ] Coordinates with Claude PM framework for data access
- [ ] Should follow managed project deployment patterns
- [ ] Aligns with framework monitoring requirements

**Testing Strategy:**
- [ ] Unit tests run automatically in CI pipeline
- [ ] Build validation ensures no TypeScript or linting errors
- [ ] Integration tests verify dashboard loads correctly
- [ ] Deployment verification checks live site functionality

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow created and functional
- [ ] Automated testing runs on every push and PR
- [ ] Production builds deploy automatically on main branch
- [ ] Live dashboard accessible via public URL
- [ ] Documentation updated with deployment information
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline tested and verified working
- [ ] Deployment process documented for future maintenance

**Implementation Tasks:**
1. [ ] Create .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml workflow file
2. [ ] Configure build and test steps in GitHub Actions
3. [ ] Set up deployment to chosen hosting platform
4. [ ] Configure environment variables and secrets
5. [ ] Test complete pipeline with sample changes
6. [ ] Update project documentation with deployment info
7. [ ] Add deployment status and monitoring
