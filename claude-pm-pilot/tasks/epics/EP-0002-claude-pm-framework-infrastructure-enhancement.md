# Epic: Claude PM Framework Infrastructure Enhancement

## Overview
This epic represents the strategic pilot migration of 5 selected tickets from the Claude PM Framework to ai-trackdown-tools to test integration benefits while maintaining framework stability. This is the execution of TRK-001 - ai-trackdown-tools Cutover Implementation.

## Objectives
- [ ] Execute controlled pilot migration of 5 framework tickets
- [ ] Validate ai-trackdown-tools integration with existing framework
- [ ] Test memory-augmented workflow capabilities
- [ ] Assess performance and usability improvements
- [ ] Document strategic recommendations for full migration

## Pilot Tickets Being Migrated
1. **TRK-001**: ai-trackdown-tools Cutover Implementation (8 pts) - CURRENT TICKET
2. **M01-044**: Comprehensive Health Slash Command (5 pts) - COMPLETED  
3. **MEM-007**: Intelligent Project Memory Indexing System (13 pts) - COMPLETED
4. **TSK-004**: Enhanced subprocess communication protocols (5 pts) - PENDING
5. **TSK-005**: Advanced task distribution patterns (5 pts) - PENDING

## Success Criteria
- All 5 pilot tickets migrated successfully with metadata preservation
- ai-trackdown workspace operational from framework directory
- Integration with health monitoring (M01-044) functional
- Memory indexing (MEM-007) includes ai-trackdown project data
- Status reporting works across both systems
- No performance degradation in task management
- Strategic assessment completed with clear recommendation

## Integration Testing Points
- **Health Monitoring**: M01-044 can monitor ai-trackdown status
- **Memory Integration**: MEM-007 indexing of ai-trackdown project
- **CLI Integration**: Framework scripts can access ai-trackdown
- **Status Reporting**: Comprehensive status across both systems

## Risk Management
- Parallel systems maintained during pilot
- Rollback ready if critical issues arise
- Framework continuity with zero disruption
- Learning-focused approach for strategic decision making

## Related Issues
- ISS-0002: TRK-001 ai-trackdown-tools Cutover Implementation
- ISS-0003: M01-044 Comprehensive Health Slash Command
- ISS-0004: MEM-007 Intelligent Project Memory Indexing System
- ISS-0005: TSK-004 Enhanced subprocess communication protocols
- ISS-0006: TSK-005 Advanced task distribution patterns

## Notes
This pilot determines whether TRK-001 becomes a full framework migration or remains a successful validation exercise. Systematic execution with comprehensive documentation is critical for strategic decision making.
