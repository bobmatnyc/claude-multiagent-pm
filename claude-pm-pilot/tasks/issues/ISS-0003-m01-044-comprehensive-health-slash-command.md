# Issue: M01-044 Comprehensive Health Slash Command

## Description
Comprehensive health monitoring system that provides detailed status information across all framework components. As part of the pilot migration, this will be tested for ai-trackdown integration capabilities.

## Original Context
- **Source**: Claude PM Framework Backlog (M01-044)
- **Story Points**: 5
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Category**: Monitoring & Observability

## Implementation Features
- System health status monitoring
- Component availability checks
- Performance metrics collection
- Integration status reporting
- Slash command interface

## Pilot Integration Testing
- [ ] Monitor ai-trackdown workspace status
- [ ] Report pilot migration health
- [ ] Integration with framework monitoring
- [ ] Cross-system status reporting

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Health command implemented and functional
- [x] Comprehensive status reporting active
- [x] Integration with existing monitoring
- [ ] ai-trackdown status monitoring added
- [ ] Pilot workspace health checks

## Integration Points
- Framework monitoring systems
- ai-trackdown workspace status
- Pilot migration progress
- Cross-system health reporting

## Success Metrics
- Health monitoring operational
- ai-trackdown integration functional
- Status reporting comprehensive
- Performance within acceptable limits

## Dependencies
- Framework monitoring infrastructure
- ai-trackdown workspace access
- Integration testing environment

## Notes
This completed ticket serves as a key integration point for testing ai-trackdown monitoring capabilities during the pilot migration.
