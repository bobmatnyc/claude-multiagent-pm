# Issue: TSK-004 Enhanced subprocess communication protocols

## Description
Advanced subprocess communication protocols designed to improve multi-agent coordination and task distribution. As part of the pilot migration, this will be tested for ai-trackdown integration and enhanced communication capabilities.

## Original Context
- **Source**: Claude PM Framework Backlog (TSK-004)
- **Story Points**: 5
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Category**: Communication & Coordination

## Implementation Features
- Enhanced subprocess communication
- Multi-agent coordination protocols
- Improved task distribution mechanisms
- Communication reliability improvements
- Protocol standardization

## Pilot Integration Testing
- [ ] Test communication with ai-trackdown processes
- [ ] Multi-agent coordination validation
- [ ] Protocol compatibility verification
- [ ] Performance impact assessment
- [ ] Integration reliability testing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Enhanced communication protocols implemented
- [ ] Multi-agent coordination improved
- [ ] ai-trackdown integration functional
- [ ] Protocol reliability verified
- [ ] Performance metrics within limits

## Integration Points
- ai-trackdown subprocess communication
- Framework agent coordination
- Multi-system protocol compatibility
- Communication reliability systems

## Communication Enhancements
- Improved message passing
- Error handling protocols
- Coordination mechanisms
- Status synchronization
- Process management

## Success Metrics
- Communication reliability improved
- ai-trackdown integration smooth
- Multi-agent coordination enhanced
- Protocol performance acceptable

## Dependencies
- Communication infrastructure
- Multi-agent systems
- ai-trackdown process access
- Integration testing framework

## Notes
This pending ticket will test enhanced communication protocols with ai-trackdown integration during the pilot migration.
