# Issue: MEM-007 Intelligent Project Memory Indexing System

## Description
Advanced memory-augmented system for intelligent project indexing and context management. As part of the pilot migration, this system will be tested for ai-trackdown project data integration and enhanced memory capabilities.

## Original Context
- **Source**: Claude PM Framework Backlog (MEM-007)
- **Story Points**: 13
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Category**: Memory & Intelligence Systems

## Implementation Features
- Intelligent project memory indexing
- Context-aware task distribution
- Memory-augmented workflow management
- Cross-project relationship mapping
- Semantic search capabilities

## Pilot Integration Testing
- [ ] Index ai-trackdown pilot workspace
- [ ] Memory integration with pilot tickets
- [ ] Context management across systems
- [ ] Intelligent cross-references
- [ ] Semantic search testing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Memory indexing system operational
- [x] Intelligent context management active
- [x] Cross-project relationships mapped
- [ ] ai-trackdown project data indexed
- [ ] Pilot workspace memory integration
- [ ] Enhanced context distribution

## Integration Points
- ai-trackdown workspace data
- Framework memory systems
- Pilot ticket relationships
- Cross-system context management

## Memory Capabilities
