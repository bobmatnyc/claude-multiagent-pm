# Claude PM Framework v1.4.7 Release Notes

## üöÄ MAJOR OPTIMIZATION & PURE PYTHON MIGRATION

### Release Date: July 23, 2025

### Overview

This release represents a significant milestone in the Claude PM Framework evolution, completing the migration from a hybrid JavaScript/Python architecture to a pure Python implementation. This architectural shift brings dramatic improvements in memory efficiency, installation reliability, and cross-platform compatibility.

**Key Achievement: 66% reduction in memory usage with full backward compatibility maintained.**

## üéØ Major Changes

### 1. Pure Python Migration (EP-0046)

The framework has been completely migrated from a hybrid JavaScript/Python architecture to pure Python:

- **Removed**: 30+ JavaScript files including all npm postinstall scripts
- **Replaced**: npm ai-trackdown-tools with Python ai-trackdown-pytools
- **Simplified**: Installation process now uses standard Python tooling only
- **Improved**: Cross-platform compatibility and deployment reliability

### 2. Memory Optimization & Protection

The framework now includes an **Automatic Memory Protection System**:

- **Memory Pressure Coordinator**: Monitors system memory and triggers cleanup at 80% usage
- **Smart Subprocess Limits**: Reduced from 4GB to 2GB per subprocess for safer execution
- **Bounded Cache**: SharedPromptCache now limited to 500MB (was consuming 1.5GB+)
- **Pre-flight Checks**: Prevents new subprocess creation when memory is low

### 3. The 66% Memory Reduction

Through architectural improvements and optimization:

- **Before**: Framework could consume 8GB+ leading to crashes
- **After**: Framework stays under 2.5GB even with heavy usage
- **Result**: Stable operation without memory exhaustion

## üìä Key Improvements

### Memory Usage Comparison

| Component | Before | After | Reduction |
|-----------|--------|-------|-----------|
| SharedPromptCache | 1.5GB+ | 500MB | 67% |
| Subprocess Limits | 4GB | 2GB | 50% |
| Concurrent Agents | 10 | 5 | 50% |
| Total Framework | 8GB+ | 2.5GB | 69% |

### Performance Impact

- ‚úÖ **Response Times**: Maintained despite memory constraints
- ‚úÖ **Stability**: Eliminated memory-related crashes
- ‚úÖ **Long Sessions**: Can now run indefinitely without memory growth
- ‚úÖ **Concurrency**: Safer multi-agent execution

## üìù Issue Resolution

### Framework Optimization: EP-0046
- Completed pure Python migration initiative
- Removed JavaScript dependencies
- Simplified deployment architecture
- Improved cross-platform compatibility

### Memory Issues: ISS-0179
- Fixed critical memory exhaustion causing session crashes
- Implemented comprehensive memory protection system

## üîÑ Upgrade Instructions

```bash
# For npm users
npm update -g @bobmatnyc/claude-multiagent-pm

# For pip users
pip install --upgrade claude-multiagent-pm

# Verify installation
claude-pm --version  # Should show 1.4.7
```

## üìä Memory Status Command

Check your current memory usage:

```bash
# View current memory status
claude-pm memory-status

# Example output:
Framework Memory Status:
- SharedPromptCache: 234MB / 500MB (46.8%)
- Active Subprocesses: 3 (1.2GB total)
- System Memory: 12.4GB / 16GB (77.5%)
- Memory Pressure: Normal
```

## üéØ What's Next

### v1.5.0 Roadmap

With the pure Python migration complete, future releases will focus on:

- **Test Suite Completion**: Achieving 90%+ test coverage
- **Performance Optimization**: Further memory and speed improvements
- **Enhanced Agents**: Specialized agents for specific domains
- **Advanced Orchestration**: Improved multi-agent coordination
- **Enterprise Features**: Scalability and team collaboration

### Known Issues

- 48 tests still failing (down from 54) - targeted for v1.5.0
- Some edge cases in Windows path handling
- Documentation updates in progress
