# Claude PM Framework v1.4.7 Release Notes

## üö® CRITICAL MEMORY OPTIMIZATION RELEASE

### Release Date: July 22, 2025

### Why This Release is Critical

Users have been experiencing frequent session crashes when working with large codebases or running multiple concurrent agents. These crashes were caused by uncontrolled memory growth that could consume 8GB+ of system memory, leading to complete system freezes.

**This release fixes these crashes automatically - no user action required.**

## üõ°Ô∏è Automatic Memory Protection

### What's New

The Claude PM Framework now includes an **Automatic Memory Protection System** that prevents memory exhaustion without any configuration:

- **Memory Pressure Coordinator**: Monitors system memory and triggers cleanup at 80% usage
- **Smart Subprocess Limits**: Reduced from 4GB to 2GB per subprocess for safer execution
- **Bounded Cache**: SharedPromptCache now limited to 500MB (was consuming 1.5GB+)
- **Pre-flight Checks**: Prevents new subprocess creation when memory is low

### The 66% Memory Reduction

Through careful optimization, we've achieved a **66% reduction in memory usage**:

- **Before**: Framework could consume 8GB+ leading to crashes
- **After**: Framework stays under 2.5GB even with heavy usage
- **Result**: No more out-of-memory crashes

## üìä Key Improvements

### Memory Usage Comparison

| Component | Before | After | Reduction |
|-----------|--------|-------|-----------|
| SharedPromptCache | 1.5GB+ | 500MB | 67% |
| Subprocess Limits | 4GB | 2GB | 50% |
| Concurrent Agents | 10 | 5 | 50% |
| Total Framework | 8GB+ | 2.5GB | 69% |

### Performance Impact

- ‚úÖ **Response Times**: Maintained despite memory constraints
- ‚úÖ **Stability**: Eliminated memory-related crashes
- ‚úÖ **Long Sessions**: Can now run indefinitely without memory growth
- ‚úÖ **Concurrency**: Safer multi-agent execution

## üîß Technical Details

### Memory Protection Features

1. **Automatic Garbage Collection**
   - Triggers at 80% system memory usage
   - Cleans up unused caches and temporary data
   - Runs without interrupting active operations

2. **Smart Subprocess Management**
   - Pre-flight memory availability checks
   - Reduced memory inheritance from parent process
   - Automatic cleanup on subprocess completion

3. **Bounded Caching**
   - SharedPromptCache limited to 500MB
   - LRU eviction for old entries
   - Prevents unbounded growth

4. **Memory Diagnostics**
   - `claude-pm memory-status` command
   - Memory metrics in health monitoring
   - Detailed memory logs for debugging

## üöÄ User Benefits

### Immediate Improvements

- **No More Crashes**: Sessions remain stable even with heavy usage
- **Better Performance**: Reduced memory pressure improves system responsiveness
- **Multiple Projects**: Can work on several projects without memory issues
- **Long Sessions**: Framework remains stable over extended periods

### No Action Required

This release includes automatic protections that activate immediately upon installation:

- No configuration files to edit
- No environment variables to set
- No manual memory management needed
- Just update and enjoy stable operation

## üìù Issue Resolution

### Primary Fix: ISS-0179
- Fixed critical memory exhaustion causing session crashes
- Implemented comprehensive memory protection system
- Added memory diagnostics and monitoring

### Consolidated: ISS-0003
- Memory optimization requirements incorporated into ISS-0179
- All memory-related improvements delivered in this release

## üîÑ Upgrade Instructions

```bash
# For npm users
npm update -g @bobmatnyc/claude-multiagent-pm

# For pip users
pip install --upgrade claude-multiagent-pm

# Verify installation
claude-pm --version  # Should show 1.4.7
```

## üìä Memory Status Command

Check your current memory usage:

```bash
# View current memory status
claude-pm memory-status

# Example output:
Framework Memory Status:
- SharedPromptCache: 234MB / 500MB (46.8%)
- Active Subprocesses: 3 (1.2GB total)
- System Memory: 12.4GB / 16GB (77.5%)
- Memory Pressure: Normal
```

## üéØ What's Next

Future releases will continue to optimize memory usage while adding new features:

- Configurable memory limits for power users
- Per-agent memory budgets
- Advanced memory profiling tools
- Further cache optimizations

## üôè Acknowledgments

Thank you to all users who reported memory issues and helped us identify the root causes. Your detailed crash reports and system logs were invaluable in developing this comprehensive solution.
