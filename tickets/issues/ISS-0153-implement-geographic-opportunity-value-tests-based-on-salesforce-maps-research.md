title: Implement Geographic Opportunity Value Tests Based on Salesforce Maps Research
description: >-
  ## Summary


  Based on comprehensive research into Salesforce Maps visualization capabilities, this ticket proposes implementing
  geographic-aware opportunity value generation for the mock data system. This will enable realistic testing of
  map-based opportunity visualizations in the travel/hospitality industry context.


  ## Key Research Findings


  ### Salesforce Maps Visualization Capabilities

  - **Heat Maps**: Show opportunity density and value concentration by region

  - **Bubble Maps**: Display individual opportunities with size based on value

  - **Territory Planning**: Visualize opportunity distribution across sales territories

  - **Route Optimization**: Plan visits based on opportunity value and proximity


  ### Geographic Value Patterns

  The research identified typical opportunity value distributions in travel/hospitality:

  - **40% Urban Markets**: High-value opportunities ($100K-$1M+)

  - **35% Secondary Markets**: Medium-value opportunities ($50K-$250K)

  - **25% Tertiary Markets**: Lower-value opportunities ($10K-$100K)


  ## Proposed Implementation


  ### 1. Geographic Distribution Generator

  Create opportunity data that follows realistic geographic patterns:

  - Cluster opportunities around major metropolitan areas

  - Distribute based on market size and travel industry presence

  - Include seasonal variations (peak travel seasons)


  ### 2. Value Assignment Logic

  Implement market-based pricing that considers:

  - Market tier (urban/secondary/tertiary)

  - Seasonal factors (20-40% variation)

  - Industry segments (corporate, leisure, group travel)

  - Deal size patterns (booking volume, contract length)


  ### 3. Visualization-Ready Output

  Generate data formatted for Salesforce Maps:

  - Latitude/longitude coordinates

  - Aggregation-friendly structure

  - Multiple zoom levels (city, state, region)

  - Performance-optimized for large datasets


  ### 4. Edge Case Coverage

  Include scenarios for robust testing:

  - Sparse data regions

  - High-density opportunity clusters

  - Cross-border opportunities

  - Territory overlap situations


  ## Technical Implementation Notes


  ### Data Structure

  ```python

  opportunity = {
      'id': 'opp_12345',
      'name': 'Marriott Downtown - 2025 Corporate Contract',
      'amount': 250000,
      'stage': 'Negotiation',
      'close_date': '2025-03-15',
      'account': {
          'name': 'Marriott Downtown Chicago',
          'industry': 'Hospitality',
          'type': 'Hotel Chain'
      },
      'location': {
          'latitude': 41.8781,
          'longitude': -87.6298,
          'city': 'Chicago',
          'state': 'IL',
          'country': 'USA',
          'market_tier': 'urban',
          'territory': 'Midwest'
      },
      'seasonal_factor': 1.3,  # Peak season multiplier
      'probability': 0.75
  }

  ```


  ### Geographic Intelligence Features

  - Market-aware value generation

  - Distance-based opportunity clustering

  - Territory boundary respect

  - Regional seasonality patterns


  ## Business Value

  This enhancement will enable:

  - Realistic testing of Salesforce Maps visualizations

  - Better understanding of geographic opportunity patterns

  - Improved territory planning capabilities

  - More accurate sales forecasting based on location


  ## Acceptance Criteria

     - [ ] Validate clustering patterns around metropolitan areas

  2. **Value Generation**
     - [ ] Urban market opportunities range from $100K to $1M+
     - [ ] Secondary market opportunities range from $50K to $250K
     - [ ] Tertiary market opportunities range from $10K to $100K
     - [ ] Apply seasonal adjustments (20-40% variation based on travel patterns)
     - [ ] Support multiple industry segments (corporate, leisure, group)

  3. **Visualization Support**
     - [ ] Generate valid latitude/longitude coordinates for all opportunities
     - [ ] Support heat map visualization data format
     - [ ] Support bubble map visualization data format

     - [ ] Ensure performance with datasets of 10K+ opportunities

  4. **Edge Cases**
     - [ ] Handle sparse data regions appropriately
     - [ ] Support high-density clusters (e.g., NYC, LA)
     - [ ] Generate cross-border opportunities where applicable
     - [ ] Handle territory overlap scenarios

  5. **Data Quality**
     - [ ] All generated coordinates are valid and within appropriate bounds
     - [ ] Opportunity values follow logarithmic distribution within each tier
