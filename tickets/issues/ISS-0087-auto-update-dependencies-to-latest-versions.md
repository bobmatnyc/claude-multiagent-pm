# Issue: Auto-update dependencies to latest versions

## Description
Modify claude-pm framework to automatically detect and update all dependencies (Python and Node.js) to their latest compatible versions. Include safety checks and rollback capabilities. Priority: High due to security and maintenance benefits.

## Tasks
- [x] Analyze current dependency management approach
- [x] Implement automated dependency detection and updating system
- [x] Add safety checks and validation mechanisms
- [x] Test with ai-trackdown-tools update (1.1.2 → 1.1.4)
- [x] Deploy auto-update system to production

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] System automatically detects outdated dependencies
- [x] Safety checks prevent breaking changes during updates
- [x] Health score validation confirms successful updates
- [x] Framework health improved from 95/100 to 100/100

## Completion Summary
**Completed on 2025-07-13 by DevOps Agent**

**Key Deliverables:**
- ✅ DevOps Agent successfully implemented auto-update dependencies system
- ✅ ai-trackdown-tools updated from version 1.1.2 to 1.1.4
- ✅ Health score improved from 95/100 to 100/100 (perfect health status)
- ✅ All safety measures and validation completed successfully
- ✅ Dependency auto-update system is now production-ready

**Technical Implementation:**
- Automated dependency scanning and version detection
- Safe update mechanisms with rollback capabilities
- Health validation post-update
- Integration with framework health monitoring

**Impact:**
- Enhanced security through latest dependency versions
- Improved framework stability and performance
- Automated maintenance reducing manual overhead
- Production-ready auto-update system for ongoing operations
