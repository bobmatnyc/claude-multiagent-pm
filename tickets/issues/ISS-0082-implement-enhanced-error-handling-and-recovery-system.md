title: Implement Enhanced Error Handling and Recovery System
description: >-
  ## Overview

  Implement comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms with automatic recovery strategies and circuit breaker
  patterns.


  ## Error Classification System:

  **Error Severity Levels:**

  - RECOVERABLE (can be automatically resolved)

  - DEGRADED (functionality reduced but operational)

  - BLOCKING (requires user intervention)

  - CRITICAL (system integrity at risk)


  **Error Context Categories:**

  - AGENT_SUBPROCESS (agent subprocess failures)

  - TASK_TOOL (task tool communication issues)

  - FRAMEWORK_OPERATION (framework operation failures)

  - DEPENDENCY (dependency-related issues)

  - CONFIGURATION (configuration problems)

  - NETWORK (network-related failures)

  - FILESYSTEM (file system issues)


  ## Recovery Mechanisms:

  - Automatic recovery strategies by error type

  - Retry with exponential backoff

  - Fallback to alternative implementations

  - Graceful degradation with reduced functionality

  - Context preservation for manual retry

  - Circuit breaker pattern implementation


  ## Implementation Components:

  - RecoveryManager class with strategy mapping

  - CircuitBreaker implementation for external services

  - Error escalation system to user with suggestions

  - Recovery validation and verification


  ## Success Criteria:

  - Error recovery success rate >80%

  - Graceful handling of common failure scenarios

  - Circuit breaker functionality validated
