# Issue: Implement Agent Loader API for User Agent Management

## Description
API endpoints for user agent CRUD operations with security boundaries preventing system agent modification. Integration with hierarchical agent discovery system and agent registry v0.9.0.

### Scope Definition

**INCLUDED:**
- User agents (project-specific, user-defined directories)
- API Operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete user agents
- Integration with existing agent registry v0.9.0
- Hierarchical precedence respect
- Agent template system integration
- Metadata management and discovery

**EXCLUDED:**
- System agents (claude_pm/agents/ - code only modification)
- Direct system agent API manipulation

### Security Constraints
- System agents remain code-only (no API modification)
- User agent operations limited to authorized directories
- Validation of agent specifications before creation/modification
- Safe deletion with dependency checking

## Technical Requirements

### API Operations Specification

#### Create Agent
- Template-based agent creation from standardized templates
- Metadata validation and storage with proper schema
- Directory precedence awareness and conflict resolution
- Integration with existing agent hierarchy

#### Read Agent
- Agent discovery and enumeration across hierarchy
- Metadata retrieval and formatted output
- Hierarchical precedence reporting and status
- Agent health checking and validation

#### Update Agent
- Safe modification of existing user agents only
- Version tracking and automatic backup creation
- Validation of changes before application
- Dependency impact analysis and reporting

#### Delete Agent
- Safe removal with comprehensive dependency checking
- Automatic backup creation before deletion
- Cascade analysis for dependent components
- Confirmation workflows for critical deletions

### Integration Requirements
- Work with existing AgentPromptBuilder infrastructure
- Leverage SharedPromptCache for performance optimization
- Integrate seamlessly with agent registry v0.9.0
- Maintain compatibility with current hierarchical loader
- Support for future agent modification tracking systems

### Performance Targets
- Agent CRUD operations: <200ms response time
- Agent discovery integration: <100ms for hierarchy scan
- API response times: <500ms for complex operations
- Cache utilization: >90% for repeated operations

## Tasks

### Phase 1: API Foundation
- [ ] Design REST API or Python API interface specifications
- [ ] Implement security boundary enforcement (system agent protection)
- [ ] Create agent validation system for specifications and metadata
- [ ] Build template system integration for standardized creation

### Phase 2: CRUD Operations
- [ ] Implement Create Agent functionality with template support
- [ ] Implement Read Agent functionality with hierarchy awareness
- [ ] Implement Update Agent functionality with safety checks
- [ ] Implement Delete Agent functionality with dependency validation

### Phase 3: Integration & Performance
- [ ] Integrate with AgentPromptBuilder and SharedPromptCache
- [ ] Implement agent registry v0.9.0 integration
- [ ] Add hierarchical precedence support and reporting
- [ ] Optimize performance to meet target metrics

### Phase 4: Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for all CRUD operations
- [ ] Implement integration tests with existing systems
- [ ] Write API documentation and usage examples
- [ ] Conduct security testing and validation

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality
- [ ] API can create new user agents from templates successfully
- [ ] API can modify existing user agents safely without corruption
- [ ] API can delete user agents with proper validation and backups
- [ ] System agents remain completely protected (code only, no API access)
- [ ] Integration with agent registry for discovery works seamlessly

### Security & Safety
- [ ] Security boundaries enforced consistently across all operations
- [ ] Comprehensive validation and error handling implemented
- [ ] Safe deletion with dependency checking prevents orphaned references
- [ ] Backup creation and recovery mechanisms function properly

### Performance & Integration
- [ ] Performance targets met for all operations (<200ms CRUD, <100ms discovery)
- [ ] Cache utilization exceeds 90% for repeated operations
- [ ] Hierarchical precedence respected in all agent operations
- [ ] Integration with existing systems maintains compatibility

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Unit tests achieve >95% code coverage
- [ ] Integration tests validate end-to-end workflows
- [ ] Documentation covers all API endpoints and usage patterns
- [ ] Security testing validates protection mechanisms

## Technical Architecture

### API Interface Options
1. **REST API**: HTTP endpoints for web-based integration
2. **Python API**: Direct Python module interface for framework integration
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Both REST and Python APIs with shared core logic

### Data Flow
```
User Request → API Validation → Security Check → Agent Operation → Registry Update → Response
```

### Directory Structure Integration
- Current Directory: `$PWD/.claude-pm/agents/` (highest precedence)
- Parent Directories: Walk up tree checking `.claude-pm/agents/`
- User Directory: `~/.claude-pm/agents/`
- System Directory: `claude_pm/agents/` (protected, no API access)

## Dependencies
- Agent Registry v0.9.0 (foundation system)
- AgentPromptBuilder (existing infrastructure)
- SharedPromptCache (performance optimization)
- Hierarchical Agent Loader (current discovery system)

## Future Considerations
- Agent versioning and rollback capabilities
- Agent marketplace and sharing features
- Advanced agent template management
- Integration with external agent repositories
- Agent performance monitoring and analytics
- Agent modification tracking and audit trails

## Notes
This API will provide the foundation for user agent lifecycle management while maintaining strict security boundaries. The implementation must respect the existing hierarchical system and provide safe, validated operations for user agents only.
