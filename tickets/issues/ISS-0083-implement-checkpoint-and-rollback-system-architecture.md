title: Implement Checkpoint and Rollback System Architecture
description: >-
  ## Overview

  Implement comprehensive checkpoint and rollback system for safe experimentation and state management with multiple
  checkpoint types and scopes.


  ## Checkpoint Types:

  - AUTOMATIC (automatic before major operations)

  - MANUAL (user-requested checkpoints)

  - WORKFLOW (workflow milestone checkpoints)

  - EMERGENCY (emergency state preservation)


  ## Checkpoint Scopes:

  - FRAMEWORK (full framework state)

  - PROJECT (project-specific state)

  - AGENT (individual agent state)

  - WORKFLOW (workflow execution state)


  ## Storage Structure:

  ```

  ```


  ## Implementation Components:

  - CheckpointManager class with create/restore/list/validate methods

  - CheckpointStorage backend with integrity validation

  - CheckpointMetadata management system

  - Rollback strategies: immediate, staged, selective, progressive


  ## Success Criteria:

  - Checkpoint/rollback success rate >99%

  - Checkpoint creation time <10 seconds for framework scope

  - Integrity validation and restoration verified
