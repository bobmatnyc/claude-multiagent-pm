**Issue ID**: ISS-0170  
**Created**: 2025-07-20  
**Status**: Open  
**Priority**: Low  
**Type**: Test  
**Epic**: None (Test Ticket)  

## Summary
Testing agent-ticket interaction during orchestration with the new ticketed hello world protocol.

## Description
This is a test ticket created to verify the ticketed hello world functionality in the base agent template. The purpose is to test that agents can successfully:

1. Receive ticketed hello world requests from PM orchestrator
2. Post appropriate hello world comments to this ticket
3. Demonstrate proper agent-ticket comment functionality
4. Verify the full orchestration flow: PM → Agent → PM → Ticketing Agent

## Test Scenarios
- Various core agents will be instructed to add hello world comments
- Each agent should demonstrate their unique ticketed hello world response
- Comments should include agent identification and timestamp
- Test both single and multi-agent orchestration patterns

## Expected Behavior
Agents instructed to perform ticketed hello world will:
1. Generate their unique hello world message
2. Request PM to delegate to Ticketing Agent for comment posting
3. Include this ticket ID (ISS-0170) in their response
4. Comments will accumulate on this ticket showing agent participation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Documentation Agent posts hello world comment
- [ ] QA Agent posts hello world comment  
- [ ] Research Agent posts hello world comment
- [ ] Engineer Agent posts hello world comment
- [ ] Version Control Agent posts hello world comment
- [ ] At least 3 different agents have posted comments
- [ ] All comments include proper agent identification
- [ ] Orchestration flow works end-to-end

## Notes
This is a temporary test ticket that can be closed once ticketed hello world functionality is verified.
