title: Documentation Reorganization - Clean Structure and Archive Old Content
description: |-
  ## Current State
  The documentation is currently disorganized with:
  - 250+ documentation files total
  - 219 files in old/ directory needing review
  - Poor discoverability and navigation
  - Mixed content types without clear categorization
  - Duplicate and outdated content

  ## Proposed New Structure
  Implement a clean, hierarchical documentation structure:
  - **user/** - End-user documentation (getting started, guides, tutorials)
  - **developer/** - Development documentation (API, contributing, architecture)
  - **technical/** - Technical specifications and deep dives
  - **releases/** - Release notes and changelogs
  - **archive/** - Historical documentation for reference

  ## Implementation Plan (5 Phases)
  **Phase 1: Backup and Infrastructure**
  - Create full backup of current documentation
  - Set up new directory structure
  - Prepare migration scripts

  **Phase 2: Core Documentation Migration**
  - Migrate active, high-value documentation
  - Update all internal links
  - Ensure no broken references

  **Phase 3: Archive Management**
  - Review and categorize old/ content
  - Archive historical documentation
  - Remove truly obsolete content

  **Phase 4: Navigation and Discovery**
  - Create comprehensive index/README files
  - Build documentation map
  - Add cross-references and navigation aids

  **Phase 5: Validation and Testing**
  - Validate all links and references
  - Test documentation accessibility
  - Ensure search functionality works

  ## Expected Outcomes
  - Improved documentation discoverability
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Easier maintenance and updates
  - Better user experience
  - Reduced confusion from outdated content

  ## Success Criteria
  - All active documentation migrated to new structure
  - Zero broken links after migration
  - Clear navigation paths for all user types
  - Old content properly archived or removed
  - Documentation passes quality validation

## Notes
**Project completed successfully on 2025-07-18**

All 5 phases have been implemented as planned:
- Phase 1: Infrastructure created with comprehensive backup
- Phase 2: 42 core documentation files migrated to new structure
- Phase 3: 203 old documentation files archived under docs/archive/2025/old-docs/
- Phase 4: Navigation implemented with index.md homepage and comprehensive README.md
- Phase 5: Final validation completed with full quality assessment

**Key Achievements:**
- 83% reduction in active documentation (from 250+ to 42 files)
- Clear hierarchical structure: user/, developer/, technical/, releases/, archive/
- Improved navigation with breadcrumbs and cross-references
- All quality standards met with no broken links or missing content

**Validation Report:** docs/archive/2025/reports/documentation-reorganization-validation-report.md

The documentation is now well-organized, easily navigable, and maintainable.
