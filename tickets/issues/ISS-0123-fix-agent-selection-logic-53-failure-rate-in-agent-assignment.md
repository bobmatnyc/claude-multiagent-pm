description: |-
  Investigation found 9 out of 17 agents have selection problems:
  - Rigid keyword matching (must use 'code' not 'implement')
  - Cannot trigger custom agents (PM Agent, etc.)
  - LOCAL mode ignores hierarchy (project→user→system)
  - No semantic understanding of tasks

  Impact: Users getting wrong agents for their tasks

## Notes

### [Research Agent] Analysis Complete: Agent Selection Implementation Deep Dive

**Date**: 2025-07-18
**Researcher**: Research Agent via LOCAL orchestration

#### Executive Summary
Found root causes of 53% agent selection failure rate. The issue stems from a disconnect between CLAUDE.md keyword mappings and actual LOCAL mode implementation.

#### Key Findings

1. **No Keyword Parser Exists**
   - File: `/claude_pm/orchestration/backwards_compatible_orchestrator.py`
   - The `agent_type` parameter must exactly match hardcoded dictionary keys
   - No translation from "code" → "engineer" or "implement" → "engineer"

2. **Hardcoded Agent List (Lines 457-476)**
   - Only 9 agents recognized: security, engineer, documentation, qa, research, ops, version_control, ticketing, data_engineer
   - All others fall back to generic prompt

3. **Registry Not Used for Selection**
   - AgentRegistry properly implements hierarchy and discovery
   - But LOCAL mode doesn't use it for agent selection, only for loading prompts AFTER selection

4. **Missing Components**
   - No keyword-to-agent mapping
   - No semantic understanding
   - No dynamic agent discovery
   - Project-specific agents ignored

#### Specific Fix Locations

1. **Add before line 156**: Keyword parser method
   ```python
   def _parse_agent_type_from_keywords(self, task_description: str) -> str:
       # Implement CLAUDE.md keyword patterns
   ```

2. **Modify line 450**: Use registry for discovery instead of hardcoded prompts

3. **Replace lines 457-476**: Dynamic registry-based agent loading

#### Impact Confirmed
- 9/17 agents work = 53% failure rate
- Custom agents completely inaccessible
- Users must use exact agent type strings
- Keywords from CLAUDE.md don't work

**Full technical analysis**: See `/tasks/issues/ISS-0123-research-findings.md`

### [Engineer Agent] Keyword Parser Implementation Complete

**Date**: 2025-07-18
**Engineer**: Engineer Agent via LOCAL orchestration

#### Implementation Summary

Created semantic keyword matching system to fix agent selection issues. The implementation addresses all the root causes identified by the Research Agent.

#### Key Components Implemented

1. **Created `/claude_pm/core/agent_keyword_parser.py`**
   - Comprehensive keyword-to-agent mapping based on CLAUDE.md patterns
   - Fuzzy matching with configurable threshold (default 0.6)
   - Explicit @agent_name syntax support
   - Multi-word phrase detection
   - Confidence scoring for suggestions

2. **Integrated into `/claude_pm/orchestration/backwards_compatible_orchestrator.py`**
   - Added keyword parser initialization in __init__ method
   - Integrated parsing logic at line 191 (before orchestration mode determination)
   - Automatic fallback for generic/default agent types
   - Preserves original agent_type for logging/debugging

#### Keyword Mappings Implemented

- **engineer**: "code", "implement", "develop", "programming", "fix", "bug", "feature", etc.
- **qa**: "test", "validate", "quality", "coverage", "pytest", etc.
- **research**: "research", "investigate", "analyze", "explore", "study", etc.
- **security**: "security", "scan", "vulnerability", "auth", "encrypt", etc.
- **data_engineer**: "data", "database", "schema", "sql", "migration", etc.
- **ops**: "deploy", "infrastructure", "docker", "kubernetes", etc.
- **documentation**: "document", "docs", "readme", "changelog", etc.
- **ticketing**: "ticket", "issue", "task", "jira", "sprint", etc.
- **version_control**: "branch", "merge", "git", "commit", "tag", etc.

#### Features

1. **Natural Language Processing**
   - Parses "implement user authentication" → "engineer"
   - Handles variations like "write code" → "engineer"
   - Supports compound phrases like "unit test" → "qa"

2. **Explicit Agent Selection**
   - @security syntax for direct agent specification
   - Supports aliases (e.g., @eng → engineer, @doc → documentation)

3. **Fuzzy Matching**
   - Handles typos and variations
   - Configurable similarity threshold
   - Falls back gracefully when no match found

4. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Only activates for generic/default agent types
   - Preserves existing behavior for explicit agent types
   - Logs all parsing decisions for transparency

#### Usage Examples

```python
# Natural language parsing
parser.parse_task_description("implement user auth") # → "engineer"
parser.parse_task_description("run unit tests") # → "qa"
parser.parse_task_description("research API patterns") # → "research"

# Explicit syntax
parser.parse_task_description("@security scan dependencies") # → "security"
parser.parse_task_description("@data setup database") # → "data_engineer"

# Suggestion system
parser.suggest_agent_type("code and test implementation")
# → [('engineer', 4), ('qa', 2)]
```

#### Testing

The implementation includes built-in test cases demonstrating:
- Keyword matching accuracy
- Fuzzy matching behavior
- Multi-agent suggestions
- Edge case handling

#### Next Steps

1. The keyword parser is now integrated and ready for use
2. Consider adding more specialized keywords based on usage patterns
3. Monitor logs for parsing decisions to refine mappings
4. Could extend to support confidence thresholds for auto-selection

This implementation should resolve the 53% failure rate by enabling semantic understanding of task descriptions and proper agent selection.

### [Engineer Agent] LOCAL Mode Hierarchy Support Implemented

**Date**: 2025-07-18
**Engineer**: Engineer Agent via LOCAL orchestration

#### Implementation Summary

Fixed LOCAL mode to properly use AgentRegistry for loading agents instead of hardcoded prompts, enabling full agent hierarchy support (project→user→system).

#### Key Changes

1. **Modified `/claude_pm/orchestration/backwards_compatible_orchestrator.py`**
   - Added `_get_agent_prompt_with_hierarchy()` method (lines 1011-1080)
   - Implements proper hierarchy precedence: project > user > system
   - Returns both agent prompt and tier information for logging
   - Uses synchronous AgentRegistry for consistent behavior

2. **Updated LOCAL Mode Execution** (lines 470-495)
   - Replaced hardcoded agent prompts with registry lookups
   - Now discovers agents across all hierarchy levels
   - Logs which agent tier was selected (project/user/system/fallback)
   - Maintains fast response times with caching

3. **Import Fix**
   - Changed to use `agent_registry_sync` for consistency
   - Ensures synchronous operations in LOCAL mode

#### Hierarchy Implementation Details

```python
# Discovery order enforced:
for agent_name, metadata in all_agents.items():
    if metadata.type == agent_type:
        if metadata.tier == 'project':
            # Highest precedence - use immediately
            break
        elif metadata.tier == 'user' and agent_tier != 'project':
            # Use if no project agent found
        elif metadata.tier == 'system' and agent_tier is None:
            # Fallback to system agents
```

#### Benefits

1. **All 17+ Agents Now Accessible**
   - PM Agent, Architecture Agent, and other custom agents work
   - No longer limited to 9 hardcoded agents
   
2. **True Hierarchy Support**
   - Project-specific agents take precedence
   - User-defined agents override system defaults
   - System agents provide reliable fallback

3. **Enhanced Logging**
   - Shows which agent tier was selected
   - Tracks prompt loading performance
   - Warns when falling back to generic prompts

4. **Performance Preserved**
   - SharedPromptCache integration maintained
   - Agent prompts cached by tier
   - Fast LOCAL mode response times preserved

#### Testing Verification

The implementation now properly:
- Checks project-level `.claude-pm/agents/` first
- Falls back to user-level `~/.claude-pm/agents/user/`
- Finally uses system-level framework agents
- Logs the selected tier for transparency

This completes the fix for ISS-0123, addressing the LOCAL mode hierarchy issue identified in the research findings.
