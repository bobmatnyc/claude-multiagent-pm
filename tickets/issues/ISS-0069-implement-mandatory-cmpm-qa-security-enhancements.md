title: Implement Mandatory CMPM-QA Security Enhancements
description: |-
  CRITICAL Phase 1 Security Foundation for CMPM-QA development. Must be completed before any development proceeds.

  MANDATORY SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:
  1. Chrome Extension Security Hardening
     - Strict Content Security Policy (no unsafe-eval, no unsafe-inline)
     - Minimize permissions to activeTab with runtime permission requests
     - Comprehensive input validation for content script interactions
     - Isolated world execution for all injected scripts

  2. Native Messaging Security Protocol
     - HMAC-SHA256 message signing with replay protection
     - Rate limiting (100 messages/minute maximum)
     - Comprehensive input sanitization and validation
     - Authentication failure lockout protection

  3. Agent Communication Encryption
     - AES-256-GCM encryption for all agent messages
     - Secure session management with automatic key rotation
     - Session timeout (30 minutes maximum)
     - End-to-end message integrity validation

  Framework Integration Security:
  - Leverage existing Claude PM Framework security infrastructure
  - Integrate with framework's authentication and authorization systems
  - Use framework's security configuration management
  - Align with three-tier agent hierarchy security model

  BLOCKING: ISS-0065 (Chrome Extension Development) until security foundation complete

  ## Tasks
  - [ ] **Phase 1A: Chrome Extension Security Hardening**
    - [ ] Implement strict Content Security Policy (CSP) configuration
    - [ ] Minimize permissions to activeTab with runtime permission requests
    - [ ] Add comprehensive input validation for content script interactions
    - [ ] Implement isolated world execution for all injected scripts
  - [ ] **Phase 1B: Native Messaging Security Protocol**
    - [ ] Implement HMAC-SHA256 message signing with replay protection
    - [ ] Add rate limiting (100 messages/minute maximum)
    - [ ] Implement comprehensive input sanitization and validation
    - [ ] Add authentication failure lockout protection
  - [ ] **Phase 1C: Agent Communication Encryption**
    - [ ] Implement AES-256-GCM encryption for all agent messages
    - [ ] Add secure session management with automatic key rotation
    - [ ] Implement session timeout (30 minutes maximum)
    - [ ] Add end-to-end message integrity validation
  - [ ] **Phase 1D: Framework Security Integration**
    - [ ] Leverage existing Claude PM Framework security infrastructure
    - [ ] Integrate with framework's authentication and authorization systems
    - [ ] Use framework's security configuration management
    - [ ] Align with three-tier agent hierarchy security model

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] **Security Foundation Complete**: All mandatory security requirements implemented
  - [ ] **Chrome Extension Hardened**: CSP, permissions, input validation, isolated execution
  - [ ] **Native Messaging Secured**: HMAC signing, rate limiting, input sanitization, lockout protection
  - [ ] **Agent Communication Encrypted**: AES-256-GCM, session management, timeout, integrity validation
  - [ ] **Framework Integration**: Uses existing security infrastructure and aligns with agent hierarchy
  - [ ] **Security Tests Pass**: Comprehensive security validation test suite passes
  - [ ] **Implementation Guide Created**: Complete guide for Engineer agents to follow
  - [ ] **Unblocks Development**: ISS-0065 (Chrome Extension Development) can proceed
