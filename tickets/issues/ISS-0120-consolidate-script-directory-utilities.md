title: Consolidate Script Directory Utilities
description: >-
  ## Overview

  Consolidate and organize the 26+ large scripts in the scripts/ directory
  into a structured utility framework with clear categorization, shared
  functionality, and improved maintainability.

  ## Problem Statement:

  The current scripts/ directory contains 26+ large scripts with:
  - Duplicated utility functions across multiple scripts
  - Inconsistent error handling and logging patterns
  - No clear categorization or organization structure
  - Mixed responsibilities within individual scripts
  - Difficult maintenance and feature additions

  ## Organized Utility Framework:

  **Core Script Infrastructure:**
  - `scripts/core/base_script.py` - Base class for all scripts with common functionality
  - `scripts/core/script_runner.py` - Script execution framework and coordination
  - `scripts/core/config_manager.py` - Shared configuration management
  - `scripts/core/error_handler.py` - Standardized error handling and reporting

  **Categorized Script Groups:**
  - `scripts/deployment/` - Deployment and installation scripts
  - `scripts/health/` - Health checking and monitoring scripts
  - `scripts/testing/` - Testing and validation scripts
  - `scripts/maintenance/` - Maintenance and cleanup scripts
  - `scripts/development/` - Development and debugging tools

  **Shared Utilities:**
  - `scripts/utils/file_operations.py` - Common file and directory operations
  - `scripts/utils/process_management.py` - Process execution and management
  - `scripts/utils/system_detection.py` - Platform and system detection
  - `scripts/utils/logging_helper.py` - Script-specific logging utilities

  **Configuration and Documentation:**
  - `scripts/config/script_registry.py` - Script discovery and registration
  - `scripts/config/default_configs.py` - Default configurations for all scripts
  - `scripts/docs/script_documentation.py` - Auto-generated script documentation

  ## Implementation Plan:

  **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Days 1-2)**
  1. Create base script class with common functionality
  2. Implement script execution framework
  3. Create shared configuration management
  4. Implement standardized error handling

  **Phase 2: Script Categorization (Days 2-3)**
  1. Analyze and categorize existing 26+ scripts
  2. Create category-specific directories and frameworks
  3. Extract common functionality into shared utilities
  4. Migrate scripts to new organized structure

  **Phase 3: Utility Consolidation (Day 3)**
  1. Identify and extract duplicated functionality
  2. Create shared utility modules
  3. Update all scripts to use shared utilities
  4. Implement script registry and discovery

  **Phase 4: Documentation and Validation (Day 4)**
  1. Create auto-generated script documentation
  2. Implement script validation and testing
  3. Performance optimization and cleanup
  4. Usage guidelines and best practices

  ## Success Criteria:

  - Reduce script code duplication by 60%+
  - All scripts use standardized error handling and logging
  - Clear categorization makes scripts easy to find and maintain
  - Shared utilities eliminate redundant functionality
  - Script execution time improved by 20%+
  - Maintenance effort reduced significantly

  ## Dependencies:

  - Must maintain compatibility with existing script execution patterns
  - All current script functionality must be preserved
  - External script callers must continue to work
  - Integration with deployment system must be maintained

  ## Testing Requirements:

  - Unit tests for shared utility functions
  - Integration tests for script execution framework
  - Validation tests for all migrated scripts
  - Performance testing for script execution
  - Compatibility testing with external callers

  ## Reference:

  Based on codebase analysis identifying 26+ large scripts with significant
  duplication and organization issues in the scripts/ directory.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Script code duplication reduced by 60%+
- [ ] All scripts use standardized error handling and logging
- [ ] Clear categorization makes scripts easy to find and maintain
- [ ] Shared utilities eliminate redundant functionality across scripts
- [ ] Script execution time improved by 20%+ through optimization
