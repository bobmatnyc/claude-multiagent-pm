title: Implement Enhanced Agent Integration and Subprocess Handling
description: >-
  ## Overview

  Implement enhanced agent integration with improved subprocess handling, context preservation, and agent fallback
  mechanisms.


  ## Key Features Required:

  - ✅ Improved agent subprocess communication and reliability

  - ✅ Context preservation across agent failures and restarts

  - ✅ Agent fallback mechanisms for graceful degradation

  - ✅ Enhanced Task Tool subprocess management

  - ✅ Agent health monitoring and recovery

  - ✅ Cross-agent state synchronization


  ## Implementation Components:

  **Agent Subprocess Enhancements:**

  - Robust subprocess creation and management

  - Context serialization and restoration

  - Communication channel redundancy

  - Subprocess health monitoring

  - Automatic restart with state recovery


  **Agent Fallback System:**

  - Hierarchical fallback agent selection

  - Capability mapping and matching

  - Graceful degradation strategies

  - Alternative implementation routing

  - Performance impact minimization


  **Context Preservation:**

  - Agent state serialization

  - Context recovery mechanisms

  - Cross-agent state sharing

  - Memory state preservation

  - Workflow context maintenance


  ## Success Criteria:

  - Improved agent reliability metrics

  - Context preservation validated across failures

  - Agent fallback mechanisms tested

  - Performance impact <10% overhead
