# Task: Phase 4: Setup test configuration and utilities

## Description
Configure pytest settings, organize test fixtures and utilities, and centralize test reports with proper gitignore configuration.

## Steps
1. ✅ Create test configuration files (pytest.ini, .coveragerc)
2. ✅ Create shared pytest fixtures in utils/conftest.py
3. ✅ Move test fixtures and data to organized directories
4. ✅ Move test reports to centralized location
5. ✅ Create .gitignore for reports directory

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] pytest.ini configured with proper test discovery and reporting
- [x] .coveragerc configured for coverage analysis
- [x] conftest.py created with shared fixtures
- [x] Test reports centralized in reports/ directory
- [x] Reports properly gitignored

## Completed Actions
- Created `tests/config/pytest.ini` with comprehensive test configuration
- Created `tests/config/.coveragerc` for coverage settings
- Created `tests/utils/conftest.py` with shared fixtures including:
  - Event loop fixture for async tests
  - Temporary directory fixture
  - Mock environment and API keys
  - Claude PM home directory setup
  - Mock git repository
  - Test artifact cleanup
  - Mock LLM and agent registry fixtures
- Moved test protection scenario to `tests/fixtures/projects/`
- Moved all test result JSON files to `tests/reports/results/`
- Moved validation report markdown files to `tests/reports/validation/`
- Moved JavaScript test scripts to `tests/scripts/`
- Created `.gitignore` for reports directory
- Created README.md for reports directory structure

## Notes
Phase 4 successfully completed. All test configuration is now properly organized with:
- Centralized pytest configuration supporting all test types
- Comprehensive coverage configuration
- Shared fixtures for test isolation and mocking
- Organized test reports that are gitignored
- Clear directory structure for fixtures and utilities
