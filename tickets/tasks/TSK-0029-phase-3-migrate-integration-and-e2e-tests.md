# Task: Phase 3: Migrate integration and e2e tests

## Description
Migrate integration, e2e, and performance tests to the proper directory structure as part of test suite reorganization.

## Steps
1. ✅ Move integration tests to categorized subdirectories
2. ✅ Move e2e tests to proper structure
3. ✅ Move performance tests to dedicated directory
4. ✅ Update import paths in moved files
5. ✅ Clean up empty directories

## Completed Actions
- Moved agent integration tests to `integration/agents/`
- Moved service integration tests to `integration/services/`
- Moved deployment integration tests to `integration/deployment/`
- Moved workflow integration tests to `integration/workflows/`
- Moved e2e workflow tests to `e2e/workflows/`
- Moved version-specific tests to `e2e/version-specific/`
- Moved installation tests to `e2e/installation/`
- Moved deployment tests to `e2e/deployment/`
- Moved performance tests to `performance/`
- Updated Python import paths (parent.parent → parent.parent.parent)
- Cleaned up empty directories

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All integration tests organized by category
- [x] All e2e tests in proper structure
- [x] Performance tests separated
- [x] Import paths updated and working
- [x] No duplicate or misplaced tests

## Notes
Phase 3 successfully completed. All tests have been migrated to their proper locations with updated import paths. Ready for Phase 4 (test configuration setup).
