## 📁 Project Structure

The framework works with any project structure but creates these directories:

```
your-project/
├── .claude-pm/           # Framework configuration
├── CLAUDE.md             # Project-specific AI instructions
├── docs/                 # Documentation (auto-generated)
├── src/                  # Your source code
└── README.md             # Project documentation
```

### Key Files

#### `CLAUDE.md`
Project-specific instructions for AI agents. This file helps agents understand your project's context, coding standards, and preferences.

#### `.claude-pm/`
Framework configuration directory containing:
- Agent configurations
- Project settings
- Cached data and memories

## 🔧 Configuration

# Create a new project
mkdir my-new-project
cd my-new-project

# Initialize with framework
claude-pm init --setup

# Start development
claude-pm
```

### 2. Existing Project Integration
```bash
# Navigate to existing project
cd existing-project

# Initialize framework (non-destructive)
claude-pm init

# Framework adapts to your existing structure
claude-pm
```
