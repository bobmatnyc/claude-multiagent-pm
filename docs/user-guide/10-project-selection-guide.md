# Project Selection Guide: Start Small, Build Confidence

## Overview

This guide helps you choose the right project for your first Claude PM experience. The key principle: **start with low-risk projects to build confidence**, then gradually apply AI assistance to more important codebases.

## Why Start Small?

### AI Learning Curve (2-3 Interactions Needed)

Claude PM's AI gets better as it learns your coding style and project patterns:

**Interaction 1**: AI learns your basic patterns
```bash
claude-pm analyze code
# AI: "I see you prefer functional programming style, use TypeScript, and follow strict linting rules."
```

**Interaction 2**: AI understands your preferences
```bash
claude-pm suggest refactoring
# AI: "Based on your functional style, here's a more idiomatic approach using pure functions..."
```

**Interaction 3**: AI provides tailored assistance
```bash
claude-pm implement feature
# AI: "Following your established patterns and TypeScript usage, here's an implementation that matches your style..."
```

### Risk Reduction Strategy

Starting small allows you to:
- Experience AI capabilities safely
- Learn what kinds of suggestions the AI makes
- Understand how to work effectively with AI assistance
- Build trust in the AI's recommendations
- Develop workflows that work for your team

## Common Project Selection Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Starting Too Big

**Wrong Approach**:
```bash
# Starting with main production application
cd production-ecommerce-app
claude-pm init  # Too risky!
```

**Right Approach**:
```bash
# Start with related utility
cd ecommerce-utilities/product-importer
claude-pm init  # Much safer!
```

### Mistake 2: Choosing Mission-Critical Systems

**Wrong Approach**:
```bash
# Database management system
cd database-admin-tools
claude-pm suggest optimizations  # Too risky!
```

**Right Approach**:
```bash

claude-pm init  # Safer way to learn
```

### Mistake 3: Shared Codebase Without Team Buy-in

**Wrong Approach**:
```bash
# Shared library used by 5 teams
cd shared-utils
claude-pm implement improvements  # Will affect other teams!
```

**Right Approach**:
```bash
# Personal fork for experimentation
cd shared-utils-fork
claude-pm init  # Test safely first
```

## Team Coordination for Project Selection

### Getting Team Buy-in

**Conversation Starter**:
```
"I'd like to try Claude PM on our codebase. I'm planning to start with [low-risk project] to learn how it works. Once I'm comfortable, I'd like to explore using it on [team project]. What are your thoughts?"
```

**Address Common Concerns**:
- **"Will it change our code?"** - No, everything is suggestion-based
- **"What if it breaks something?"** - Starting with non-critical projects
- **"Will it learn our patterns?"** - Yes, that's the goal - better suggestions over time
- **"Can we turn it off?"** - Yes, instant disable available

### Team Learning Approach

**Phase 1: Individual Learning**
```bash
# Each team member tries on personal project
team_member_1: ~/projects/personal-tool
team_member_2: ~/projects/side-project
team_member_3: ~/projects/utility-script
```

**Phase 2: Team Tool Enhancement**
```bash
# Work together on shared team tool
cd ~/team-tools/development-helper
# Multiple team members suggest improvements
# Review AI suggestions together
```

**Phase 3: Production Project**
```bash
# Apply to main project with established process
cd main-project
# Use established review process
# Leverage lessons learned from phases 1-2
```
