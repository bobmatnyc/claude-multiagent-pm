# FAQ: Addressing Dirk's Specific Installation and Usage Questions

## Overview

This FAQ directly addresses the specific concerns and questions raised by Dirk and similar users about installing and using Claude PM safely in professional development environments.

## Installation and Mono-Repo Questions

### Q: How do I install Claude PM in a mono-repo environment without breaking anything?

**A**: Claude PM uses **global installation** that doesn't modify your mono-repo structure:

```bash
# Safe global installation - no changes to your mono-repo
npm install -g @bobmatnyc/claude-multiagent-pm
npm install -g @bobmatnyc/ai-trackdown-tools

# Navigate to your mono-repo and verify it's unchanged
cd your-mono-repo
git status  # Should show no changes

# Claude PM works across all workspaces without modification
claude-pm status  # Detects mono-repo, ready to assist
```

**Why This is Safe**:
- ✅ No modifications to package.json files
- ✅ No dependencies added to workspaces
- ✅ Works with Lerna, Nx, Rush, Yarn workspaces
- ✅ Can be uninstalled without affecting your code

### Q: What exactly gets installed and where?

**A**: Installation creates only global tools and optional local config:

**Global Installation** (required):
```bash
/usr/local/lib/node_modules/@bobmatnyc/claude-multiagent-pm/
/usr/local/bin/claude-pm
/usr/local/bin/aitrackdown
```

**Local Configuration** (optional, created on first use):
```bash
your-project/
├── .claude-pm/          # Local config only (can be gitignored)
│   ├── config.json      # Project-specific AI settings
│   └── memory/          # AI learning data for this project
└── (all your existing files unchanged)
```

**Your Project Remains Completely Unchanged**:
- package.json - not modified
- Build scripts - not modified  
- Dependencies - not modified
- CI/CD configuration - not modified

### Q: How do I know it won't interfere with my existing build tools?

**A**: Claude PM operates independently of your build process:

**Test Your Existing Process**:
```bash
# Install Claude PM
npm install -g @bobmatnyc/claude-multiagent-pm

# Verify your existing process is unchanged
npm run build    # Should work exactly as before
npm test         # Should work exactly as before
npm run deploy   # Should work exactly as before

# Claude PM doesn't interfere
claude-pm status # Shows it's ready but hasn't changed anything
```

**Claude PM Never Touches**:
- Your package.json scripts
- Your webpack/rollup/vite configuration
- Your test runners (Jest, Mocha, etc.)
- Your CI/CD pipelines
- Your deployment scripts

### Q: Can I try it on just one part of my mono-repo first?

**A**: Yes! Claude PM supports workspace-scoped usage:

```bash
# Start with just one workspace
cd packages/utilities  # Choose least critical workspace
claude-pm init --workspace

# Use AI assistance for this workspace only
claude-pm analyze code
claude-pm suggest improvements

# Other workspaces are completely unaware of Claude PM
cd ../api
# No Claude PM here unless you explicitly add it

# Expand gradually when comfortable
cd ../frontend
claude-pm init --workspace  # Add to another workspace when ready
```

## Safety and Risk Questions

### Q: How do I use this without "messing everything up"?

**A**: Claude PM has multiple safety layers to prevent any unwanted changes:

**Safety Layer 1: AI Never Acts Automatically**
```bash
# AI only suggests, never implements
claude-pm analyze security
# AI: "Found 3 issues. Would you like to see suggested fixes? (y/n)"
# YOU decide whether to even see suggestions
# YOU decide whether to implement any of them
```

**Safety Layer 2: Instant Disable**
```bash
# If anything feels wrong, instantly disable
claude-pm disable
# AI assistance completely stopped
# Your code remains exactly as it was
```

**Safety Layer 3: Read-Only Start**
```bash
# Begin with zero-risk analysis only
claude-pm analyze quality      # Only reads, never suggests changes
claude-pm explain architecture # Only describes, never modifies
claude-pm audit dependencies   # Only reports, never updates
```

**Safety Layer 4: Progressive Control**
```bash
# Start with safe mode
claude-pm --safe-mode          # Analysis only, no suggestions

# Graduate to suggestion mode
claude-pm suggest improvements # Suggestions only, you implement

# Eventually use assisted mode
claude-pm implement feature    # AI provides code, you review and apply
```

### Q: What if the AI suggests something wrong or dangerous?

**A**: Multiple safeguards protect against bad suggestions:

**Human Review Required**:
```bash
# AI shows suggestions before you apply them
claude-pm suggest security-fix

AI Response:
"I found a SQL injection vulnerability. Here's the suggested fix:

BEFORE:
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '${userName}'`;

AFTER:
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ?';
db.query(query, [userName]);

Would you like me to show this change in your editor? (y/n)"

# YOU review the suggestion
# YOU decide if it's correct
# YOU choose whether to apply it
```

**Conservative AI Behavior**:
- AI errs on the side of caution
- Suggests small, incremental changes
- Avoids complex refactoring initially
- Warns about high-risk operations

**Easy Rollback**:
```bash
# If you apply something and don't like it
git status                    # See what changed
git diff                      # Review specific changes
git checkout -- filename     # Rollback specific file
git reset --hard HEAD        # Rollback everything if needed
```

### Q: How do I know the AI understands my project correctly?

**A**: AI understanding improves over time with validation checkpoints:

**Initial Learning Phase**:
```bash
# AI analyzes and explains what it sees
claude-pm explain architecture

AI Response:
"I see this is a Node.js Express API with:
- TypeScript throughout
- Jest for testing  
- PostgreSQL database
- Docker containerization
- Follows functional programming patterns

Is this assessment correct?"

# YOU validate the AI's understanding
# Correct any misunderstandings before proceeding
```

**Ongoing Validation**:
```bash
# Regular understanding checks
claude-pm explain patterns     # AI describes coding patterns it sees
claude-pm explain standards    # AI describes coding standards it detects

# If AI misunderstands something:
claude-pm clarify "We use React, not Vue"
claude-pm clarify "Tests should use describe/it format"
```

**Building Trust Over Time**:
- Start with simple analysis tasks
- Verify AI suggestions against your knowledge
- Gradually increase complexity as trust builds
- AI learns and improves with each interaction

## Usage and Workflow Questions

### Q: How exactly do I start? What's the first thing I should do?

**A**: Follow this specific step-by-step first-use process:

**Step 1: Choose a Safe Test Project** (5 minutes)
```bash
# Create a simple test project first - NOT your main codebase
mkdir ~/claude-pm-test
cd ~/claude-pm-test
echo "console.log('hello world');" > test.js
```

**Step 2: Initialize Claude PM** (2 minutes)
```bash
# Install globally (if not done already)
npm install -g @bobmatnyc/claude-multiagent-pm

# Initialize in test directory
claude-pm init
```

**Step 3: Try Read-Only Analysis** (3 minutes)
```bash
# Safe commands that only read and analyze
claude-pm analyze code        # Analyzes code quality
claude-pm explain structure   # Explains project structure
claude-pm audit dependencies  # Checks dependencies
```

**Step 4: Try Safe Suggestions** (5 minutes)
```bash
# Ask for suggestions (you decide what to implement)
claude-pm suggest improvements
claude-pm suggest tests
claude-pm suggest documentation
```

**Step 5: Build Confidence** (days to weeks)
```bash
# Gradually try more features
claude-pm implement test      # AI helps write a test
claude-pm suggest refactoring # AI suggests code improvements
claude-pm optimize performance # AI suggests optimizations
```

**Step 6: Apply to Real Project** (when comfortable)
```bash
# Move to actual project after building confidence
cd your-real-project
claude-pm init --workspace
```

### Q: What if I'm refactoring an existing project? Is that safe?

**A**: Refactoring is actually ideal for Claude PM, with proper precautions:

**Why Refactoring is Good for AI**:
- AI excels at identifying code patterns
- AI can suggest modernization safely
- AI helps maintain consistency during refactoring
- Existing tests validate AI suggestions

**Safe Refactoring Process**:
```bash
# Step 1: Comprehensive analysis first
claude-pm analyze technical-debt
claude-pm analyze code-quality
claude-pm identify patterns

# Step 2: Small, incremental changes
claude-pm suggest refactoring --conservative --small-changes

# Step 3: Validate each change
git add -p                    # Review each change individually
npm test                      # Run tests after each change
```

**Refactoring Safety Rules**:
1. **Always have comprehensive tests first**
2. **Make small changes, test frequently**
3. **Use feature branches for AI-assisted refactoring**
4. **Get team review before merging AI suggestions**

**Example Safe Refactoring Session**:
```bash
# Safe refactoring workflow
git checkout -b refactor/ai-assisted
claude-pm suggest refactoring --file user.js --conservative

# AI suggests one small improvement at a time
# Apply suggestion
# Run tests  
# Commit if tests pass
# Repeat for next suggestion
```

### Q: Should I start with a small project first?

**A**: **Absolutely yes!** This is the recommended approach:

**Why Start Small**:
- Learn AI behavior without risk
- Build confidence in AI suggestions
- Understand your workflow with AI
- Make mistakes safely

**Perfect Small Projects**:
```bash
# Personal utility scripts
mkdir ~/scripts/file-organizer && cd ~/scripts/file-organizer
claude-pm init

# Simple side projects
mkdir ~/projects/todo-app && cd ~/projects/todo-app
claude-pm init

# Documentation projects
cd ~/projects/docs
claude-pm init
```

**Small Project Learning Goals**:
- Week 1: Get comfortable with commands
- Week 2: Try AI suggestions for small features
- Week 3: Use AI for test generation
- Week 4: Apply learnings to bigger project

**Progression Timeline**:
```bash
# Month 1: Personal projects only
~/scripts/*, ~/learning/*, ~/personal-projects/*

# Month 2: Team tools and internal projects
~/team-tools/*, internal documentation, development utilities

# Month 3: Production code assistance
Main project with AI assistance for specific features
```
