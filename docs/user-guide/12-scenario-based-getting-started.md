- Quality of AI suggestions
- How to evaluate and apply suggestions manually

### Day 3: Try Suggestions Mode (30 minutes)

**Step 1: Create Test Suite**
```bash
# Ask AI to suggest tests
claude-pm suggest tests

# AI might suggest:
# - Test with normal input
# - Test with empty string
# - Test with null/undefined
# - Test with numbers
```

**Step 2: Implement One Test**
```bash
# Create test file based on AI suggestion
echo "// Test: greet function with normal input" > hello.test.js
echo "const assert = require('assert');" >> hello.test.js
echo "const greet = require('./hello');" >> hello.test.js
echo "assert.strictEqual(greet('Alice'), 'Hello Alice');" >> hello.test.js
echo "console.log('Test passed!');" >> hello.test.js
```

**Step 3: Run and Validate**
```bash
# Run your test
node hello.test.js

# If it works, you've successfully applied an AI suggestion!
```

---

## Scenario 2: Mono-Repo Developer

**You are**: Working in mono-repository with multiple packages/workspaces
**Your goal**: Use Claude PM safely without affecting existing tools
**Time commitment**: 1-2 hours for safe setup

### Pre-Flight Safety Check (15 minutes)

**Step 1: Backup Your Current State**
```bash
# From mono-repo root
git status                    # Ensure clean working directory
git add . && git commit -m "Pre Claude PM checkpoint"
```

**Step 2: Document Current Build Process**
```bash
# Test and document your existing process
npm run build               # Note: this should work
npm test                    # Note: this should work
npm run lint               # Note: this should work
lerna bootstrap            # If using Lerna
nx build --all            # If using Nx

# Take notes on what commands you normally use
```

**Step 3: Choose Test Workspace**
```bash
# Identify the LEAST critical workspace for testing
ls packages/               # or apps/, libs/, whatever your structure
# Choose utilities, tools, or internal packages first
```

### Safe Installation (15 minutes)

**Step 1: Global Install**
```bash
# Install globally - doesn't touch your mono-repo
npm install -g @bobmatnyc/claude-multiagent-pm
npm install -g @bobmatnyc/ai-trackdown-tools
```

**Step 2: Verify No Changes**
```bash
# Confirm your mono-repo is unchanged
git status                  # Should show no changes
npm run build              # Should work exactly as before
```

**Step 3: Test Workspace Detection**
```bash
# Check if Claude PM detects your mono-repo structure
claude-pm status

# Expected output should mention:
# - Mono-repo detected
# - Workspace manager identified (Lerna/Nx/Rush/Yarn)
# - Number of workspaces found
```

### Workspace-Scoped Usage (30 minutes)

**Step 1: Initialize Single Workspace**
```bash
# Start with one workspace only
cd packages/utilities       # Or your chosen test workspace
claude-pm init --workspace

# Check what was created
ls -la .claude-pm/
git status                  # Should only show .claude-pm/ as new
```

**Step 2: Test Analysis**
```bash
# Test AI analysis on this workspace only
claude-pm analyze code
claude-pm explain architecture
claude-pm suggest improvements
```

**Step 3: Verify Isolation**
```bash
# Confirm other workspaces are unaffected
cd ../api                   # Different workspace
claude-pm status            # Should show "not initialized"
git status                  # Should show no Claude PM files here
```

### Gradual Expansion Strategy (ongoing)

**Week 1: Single Workspace**
```bash
# Focus on one workspace
cd packages/utilities
claude-pm implement tests
claude-pm suggest refactoring --conservative
```

**Week 2: Add Second Workspace**
```bash
# Add another low-risk workspace
cd packages/shared-components
claude-pm init --workspace
claude-pm analyze dependencies
```

**Week 3: Cross-Workspace Awareness**
```bash
# Enable mono-repo coordination (optional)
cd mono-repo-root
claude-pm init --mono-repo --workspaces="packages/*"
claude-pm analyze cross-workspace-dependencies
```

### Mono-Repo Specific Commands

**Workspace Management**:
```bash
# List all workspaces
claude-pm list workspaces

# Analyze specific workspace
claude-pm analyze --workspace packages/api

# Cross-workspace dependency analysis
claude-pm analyze dependencies --cross-workspace

# Suggest workspace organization improvements
claude-pm suggest workspace-organization
```

**Build Integration**:
```bash
# Coordinate with existing build system
claude-pm validate build-order
claude-pm suggest build-optimization
claude-pm analyze affected-workspaces
```

### Troubleshooting Mono-Repo Issues

**Issue**: Claude PM not detecting mono-repo structure
```bash
# Solution: Manual configuration
claude-pm config set workspace-manager lerna  # or nx, rush, yarn
claude-pm config set workspace-pattern "packages/*"
claude-pm config set root-package-json "./package.json"
```

**Issue**: Conflicts with existing tools
```bash
# Solution: Configure exclusions
claude-pm config set ignore-patterns "node_modules,dist,build,.next"
claude-pm config set respect-workspace-boundaries true
```

## Scenario 3: Legacy Code Maintainer

**You are**: Working with older codebase that needs modernization
**Your goal**: Use AI to help refactor safely
**Time commitment**: Ongoing, start with 2-3 hours for setup

### Pre-Refactoring Assessment (45 minutes)

**Step 1: Current State Documentation**
```bash
# Document current state thoroughly
git log --oneline -20       # Recent changes
git status                  # Current state
npm test                    # Test suite status (if exists)

# Create baseline branch
git checkout -b pre-refactoring-baseline
git push origin pre-refactoring-baseline
```

**Step 2: Test Coverage Analysis**
```bash
# Install Claude PM
npm install -g @bobmatnyc/claude-multiagent-pm
cd your-legacy-project
claude-pm init

# Analyze test coverage
claude-pm analyze test-coverage
claude-pm suggest missing-tests
```

**Step 3: Technical Debt Assessment**
```bash
# Get AI analysis of technical debt
claude-pm analyze technical-debt
claude-pm analyze code-quality
claude-pm identify anti-patterns
claude-pm suggest modernization-priorities
```

### Safe Refactoring Strategy (ongoing)

**Phase 1: Improve Tests First**
```bash
# Before refactoring code, improve test coverage
claude-pm suggest tests --comprehensive
claude-pm implement test --file legacy-module.js

# Manually review and apply test suggestions
# Run tests to ensure they pass
npm test
```

**Phase 2: Small, Incremental Changes**
```bash
# Create refactoring branch
git checkout -b refactor/ai-assisted

# Make small changes
claude-pm suggest refactoring --conservative --file old-module.js
# Apply one small change at a time
# Test after each change
npm test

# Commit frequently
git add -p                  # Review each change
git commit -m "Refactor: apply AI suggestion for function naming"
```

**Phase 3: Modernization**
```bash
# Gradually modernize language features
claude-pm suggest modernization --es6-features
claude-pm suggest modernization --async-await
claude-pm suggest modernization --type-safety

# Example: Convert callbacks to async/await
claude-pm convert callbacks-to-async --file user-service.js
```

### Legacy-Specific Safety Measures

**Comprehensive Testing**:
```bash
# Enhanced testing for legacy code
claude-pm generate integration-tests
claude-pm suggest edge-case-tests
claude-pm create regression-tests

# Test before and after each change
npm test                    # Unit tests
npm run integration         # Integration tests (if available)
npm run e2e                # End-to-end tests (if available)
```

**Documentation During Refactoring**:
```bash
# Document legacy patterns before changing them
claude-pm document legacy-patterns
claude-pm explain why --pattern "callback nesting"
claude-pm suggest alternatives --pattern "global variables"
```

**Rollback Strategy**:
```bash
# Always have easy rollback plan
git checkout -b refactor/step-1
# Make changes
git commit -m "Refactor step 1: modernize auth module"

# If something breaks:
git checkout main           # Return to working state
git branch -D refactor/step-1  # Remove problematic changes
```

## Scenario 7: Skeptical Developer

**You are**: Cautious about AI tools, want minimal risk exposure
**Your goal**: Evaluate Claude PM safely with maximum control
**Time commitment**: Start with 30 minutes, expand only if comfortable

### Ultra-Safe Evaluation Approach

**Phase 1: Read-Only Analysis (30 minutes)**
```bash
# Install but configure for read-only mode
npm install -g @bobmatnyc/claude-multiagent-pm
claude-pm config set mode read-only

# Test on completely isolated code
mkdir ~/claude-pm-skeptical-test
cd ~/claude-pm-skeptical-test
echo "function add(a, b) { return a + b; }" > test.js
claude-pm init --read-only

# Try analysis commands that cannot modify anything
claude-pm analyze code          # Only reads and reports
claude-pm explain patterns      # Only explains what it sees
claude-pm audit security       # Only identifies potential issues
```

**Phase 2: Suggestion Mode (if Phase 1 acceptable)**
```bash
# Enable suggestions but not implementation
claude-pm config set mode suggestion-only

# AI can suggest but not implement
claude-pm suggest improvements  # Shows suggestions, you decide
claude-pm suggest tests         # Shows test ideas, you implement

# You maintain complete control:
# - AI cannot modify files
# - AI cannot run commands
# - AI can only provide text suggestions
```

**Phase 3: Assisted Mode (if Phases 1-2 acceptable)**
```bash
# Enable assisted implementation with manual approval
claude-pm config set mode assisted
claude-pm config set require-confirmation true

# Every action requires explicit approval:
claude-pm implement feature "validation"
# AI: "I will create a validation function. Proceed? (y/n)"
# You: Choose whether to proceed
# AI: Shows code, asks for approval to save
# You: Choose whether to save
```

### Skeptical Developer Safety Net

**Multiple Confirmation Points**:
```bash
# Configure multiple approval gates
claude-pm config set confirmation-level paranoid
claude-pm config set show-diff-before-apply true
claude-pm config set require-explicit-yes true

# Example interaction:
$ claude-pm suggest fix
AI: "Found issue in line 42. Show suggested fix? (yes/no)"
You: "yes"
AI: "Here's the fix: [shows code]. Apply this fix? (yes/no)"
You: "yes"  
AI: "Apply will modify test.js. Final confirmation? (yes/no)"
You: "yes"
```

**Comprehensive Logging**:
```bash
# Log everything for review
claude-pm config set log-level verbose
claude-pm config set log-all-suggestions true
claude-pm config set log-all-confirmations true

# Review logs
tail -f ~/.claude-pm/logs/detailed.log
claude-pm show interaction-history
```

**Easy Abort Options**:
```bash
# Multiple ways to stop immediately
claude-pm disable              # Disable all functionality
claude-pm config set mode read-only  # Return to read-only
claude-pm abort                # Stop current operation
Ctrl+C                         # Emergency stop
```
