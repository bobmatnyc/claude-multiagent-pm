await trainer.start_training_system()

# Train an agent
session = await trainer.train_agent_response(
    agent_type="engineer",
    original_response="def fibonacci(n): return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)",
    context={"task": "implement fibonacci efficiently"},
    training_mode=TrainingMode.CONTINUOUS
)

print(f"Improvement: {session.improvement_score:.1f} points")
```

### Framework Integration
```python
# Initialize integration
integration = AgentTrainingIntegration(config)
await integration.start_integration()

# Train based on subprocess response
result = await integration.train_subprocess_response(
    subprocess_id="task_001",
    agent_type="engineer",
    original_response="basic implementation",
    user_correction="optimized implementation",
    context={"task": "code optimization"}
)

# Deploy if significant improvement
if result['improvement_score'] > 15.0:
    await integration.deploy_trained_agent(
        agent_type="engineer",
        training_session_id=result['session_id']
    )
```

### Performance Analytics
