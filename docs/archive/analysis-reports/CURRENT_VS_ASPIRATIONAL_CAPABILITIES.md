## Capability Comparison Matrix

| Feature Area | Documentation Claims | Current Reality | Gap Severity | Bridge Solution |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Agent Orchestration** | Sophisticated multi-agent coordination | Basic subprocess creation | CRITICAL | Memory profiles |
| **Agent Hierarchy** | Three-tier precedence system | Directory structure exists, unused | MAJOR | Manual hierarchy in memory |

| **Cross-Agent Coordination** | Hand-in-hand collaboration | Independent subprocess operation | MAJOR | Sequential workflows |
| **State Persistence** | Agent memory and session continuity | No persistence between calls | MODERATE | Memory profile state |
| **Authority Delegation** | Agents have decision-making authority | No authority implementation | MODERATE | Memory-based roles |

## Feature-by-Feature Analysis

### 1. Agent Orchestration

**Documentation Promise**:
```
PM operates as an orchestrator exclusively through Task Tool subprocess delegation
- Never Perform Direct Work
- Always Use Task Tool
- Comprehensive Context Provision
```

**Current Reality**:
- Task Tool creates basic subprocess with minimal framework integration
- No orchestration intelligence beyond basic delegation
- PM still needs to perform direct work for complex tasks

**Assessment**: **CRITICAL GAP** - Core framework premise not implemented

**Bridge Solution**: Memory-based agent profiles can provide specialization within current subprocess model

### 2. Three-Tier Agent Hierarchy

**Documentation Promise**:
```
1. Project Agents: $PROJECT/.claude-pm/agents/project-specific/
2. User Agents: ~/.claude-pm/agents/user-defined/
3. System Agents: /framework/claude_pm/agents/
```

**Current Reality**:
- Directories exist but are not scanned or loaded
- No precedence system implementation
- No agent capability detection from hierarchy

**Assessment**: **MAJOR GAP** - Fundamental architecture missing

**Bridge Solution**: Manual hierarchy specification in memory profiles

### 3. Context Integration

**Documentation Promise**:
```
Provide rich, filtered context specific to each agent's domain and responsibilities
```

**Current Reality**:
- Basic prompt text passed to subprocess
- No domain filtering or specialization
- No project context integration beyond what's manually included

**Assessment**: **SEVERE GAP** - Context system not operational

**Bridge Solution**: Memory profiles can contain domain-specific context and reasoning patterns

### 4. Agent Specialization

**Documentation Promise**:
```
**Documentation Agent** - **CORE AGENT TYPE**
**Ticketing Agent** - **CORE AGENT TYPE**  
**Version Control Agent** - **CORE AGENT TYPE**
```

**Current Reality**:
- All agents are generic Claude instances
- No specialized behaviors or capabilities
- No domain-specific knowledge loading

**Assessment**: **CRITICAL GAP** - Core agent types don't exist as described

**Bridge Solution**: Memory profiles provide effective agent specialization

## What Actually Works vs What's Documented

### ✅ Current Working Features:

1. **Basic Task Delegation**
   - Can create subprocess instances
   - Can pass prompt text to agents
   - Agents can respond with results

2. **Directory Structure**
   - Framework directories exist
   - Configuration files present
   - Template system operational

3. **Memory Enhancement**
   - Memory-based agent profiles work effectively
   - Can provide domain specialization
   - Enhanced reasoning capabilities demonstrated

### ❌ Non-Working Documented Features:

1. **Agent Type Detection**
   - No system to identify agent capabilities
   - No loading from agent directories
   - No specialization beyond memory profiles

2. **Hierarchical Loading**
   - Three-tier system not implemented
   - No precedence resolution
   - No agent override capabilities

3. **Context Filtering**
   - No domain-specific context preparation
   - No automatic project context integration
   - No agent-aware context selection

4. **Cross-Agent Coordination**
   - No agent-to-agent communication
   - No shared state management
   - No workflow orchestration beyond sequential calls

## Practical Usage Recommendations

### Current Best Practices:

1. **Use Task Tool for Basic Delegation**
   ```
   Task Tool: Create subprocess for specific task with comprehensive context
   ```

2. **Enhance with Memory Profiles**
   ```
   Memory Profile: Load domain-specific agent capabilities
   Context: Provide specialized reasoning and knowledge
   ```

3. **Design Sequential Workflows**
   - Plan for independent agent operation
   - Use clear handoffs between agents
   - Manage coordination manually

### Avoid These Documented Features (Not Implemented):

1. **Don't Expect Agent Hierarchy Loading**
2. **Don't Rely on Automatic Context Filtering**
3. **Don't Assume Agent Specialization Without Memory Profiles**
4. **Don't Plan for Cross-Agent State Sharing**

## Implementation Priority Matrix

### High Priority (Immediate):
- **Documentation Updates**: Align docs with reality
- **Memory Profile System**: Standardize agent enhancement
- **User Expectation Management**: Clear capability communication

### Medium Priority (Short Term):
- **Basic Hierarchy Implementation**: Agent directory scanning
- **Context Enhancement**: Improved context preparation
- **Profile Management**: Memory profile loading system

### Low Priority (Long Term):
- **Advanced Orchestration**: Cross-agent coordination
- **State Management**: Persistent agent memory
- **Full Framework Vision**: Complete implementation

## Honest Capability Assessment

### What the Framework Does Well:
- Provides structure for multi-agent workflows
- Enables memory-enhanced agent capabilities
- Offers practical task delegation patterns
- Creates foundation for future enhancements

### What the Framework Struggles With:
- Sophisticated agent orchestration as documented
- Automatic hierarchy and context management
- Cross-agent coordination and state sharing
- Seamless agent specialization without manual setup

### What Users Should Expect:
- Basic but effective task delegation
- Enhanced capabilities through memory profiles
- Manual workflow coordination
- Gradual implementation of documented features

## Conclusion

The Claude PM Framework documentation describes capabilities that significantly exceed current implementation. However, the framework provides a solid foundation with memory-based enhancement offering practical bridge solutions.

**Key Takeaway**: The framework is more aspirational documentation than complete implementation, but memory profiles provide an effective path to enhanced capabilities within current constraints.

**Recommendation**: Update documentation to reflect current reality while maintaining vision for future implementation.
