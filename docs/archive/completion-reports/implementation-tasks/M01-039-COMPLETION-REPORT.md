- Health checks and diagnostic tools
- Docker container health monitoring

## Technical Implementation Details

### Core Framework Changes

The Engineer Agent previously implemented the core CLAUDE_PM_ROOT support in:
- `claude_pm/core/config.py`: Dynamic path resolution based on environment variable
- `claude_pm/cli.py`: Helper functions for path management
- Configuration system with fallback to default paths

### Deployment Templates Created

#### Development Environment
- Debug logging enabled
- Relaxed security settings
- Hot reload support
- Local service integration

#### Staging Environment
- Production-like configuration
- SSL/TLS testing capability
- Performance monitoring
- Blue-green deployment testing

#### Production Environment
- Strict security settings
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Backup and recovery configuration
- Performance optimization
- Compliance features (SOC2, GDPR)

#### Docker Environment
- Container-optimized settings
- Service discovery configuration
- Volume management
- Resource limits and health checks

### Migration Support

Created tools to help users migrate from hardcoded paths:

1. **Automated Migration**: Script handles the entire migration process
2. **Manual Migration**: Step-by-step guide for custom scenarios
3. **Validation**: Pre and post-migration validation
4. **Rollback**: Backup and recovery procedures

## Environment Variable Implementation

### Default Behavior (Backward Compatible)
```bash
# No environment variable set - uses default path
~/Projects/Claude-PM
```

### Custom Path Configuration
```bash
# Custom installation location
export CLAUDE_PM_ROOT=/opt/claude-pm
export CLAUDE_PM_ROOT=/srv/applications/claude-pm
export CLAUDE_PM_ROOT=/Users/username/custom/path
```

### Container Configuration
```bash
# Container standardized paths
CLAUDE_PM_ROOT=/app/claude-pm
```

## Deployment Scenarios Supported

1. **Local Development**: Default or custom local paths
2. **Staging Environment**: Production-like testing environment
3. **Production Server**: Secure production deployment
4. **Docker Container**: Containerized deployment
5. **Cloud Deployment**: AWS/GCP/Azure support templates
6. **Multi-Environment**: Multiple installations on same system

## Validation and Quality Assurance

### Environment Validation
- Python version compatibility check
- System dependencies verification
- Directory permissions validation
- Service port availability check
- Configuration syntax validation

### Migration Testing
- Dry-run capability for safe testing
- Backup creation before migration
- Rollback procedures if migration fails
- Service configuration updates
- Path validation after migration

### Production Readiness
- SSL/TLS certificate configuration
- Security hardening checklist
- Performance optimization settings
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Backup and recovery procedures

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Flexibility**: Users can install Claude PM anywhere on their system
2. **Multi-Environment**: Support for development, staging, and production
3. **Containerization**: Proper Docker support with standardized paths
4. **Migration Support**: Easy migration from existing installations
5. **Production Ready**: Comprehensive production deployment guide
6. **Validation**: Extensive validation and testing tools

# Development container
docker-compose -f deployment/docker/docker-compose.yml up

# Production container
docker-compose -f deployment/docker/docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

### Validation

```

## Next Steps and Recommendations

1. **Test Migration Tools**: Test migration scripts with existing installations
2. **Production Deployment**: Use production guide for live deployments
3. **Documentation Updates**: Update main README with CLAUDE_PM_ROOT information
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Update continuous integration to use new deployment scripts
5. **Team Training**: Train team members on new deployment procedures
