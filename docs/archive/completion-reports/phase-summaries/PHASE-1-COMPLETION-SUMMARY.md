- Memory hygiene and retention policies  
- Performance optimization with memory metrics
- Enterprise security controls
- Advanced MCP integration

## üåü Technical Achievements

### Zero-Configuration Memory
```python
# Instant memory access - no configuration required
from config.memory_config import create_claude_pm_memory
memory = create_claude_pm_memory()
memory.add_project_memory("Implemented feature successfully")
```

### Pure Task Tool Delegation
```python
# Memory-enhanced task delegation using Task tool
from claude_pm.core.service_manager import ServiceManager
service_manager = ServiceManager()
result = await service_manager.delegate_with_memory("Implement new feature")
```

### 11-Agent Ecosystem
- All agents now have memory integration through Task tool delegation
- Parallel execution with git worktree isolation  
- Intelligent context preparation with historical patterns
- Memory-driven task decomposition and coordination

## üöÄ Impact & Results
