- ✅ **Orchestrator Agent**: Task complexity analysis and routing decisions
- ✅ **Architect Agent**: Design planning for standard/complex tasks
- ✅ **Engineer Agent**: Implementation execution with simulated code generation
- ✅ **QA Agent**: Testing and validation with quality checks
- ✅ **Memory Store**: Learning pattern persistence

## 🚀 Technical Architecture

### CLI Integration Points
```python
# Real workflow execution (claude_pm/cli.py)
task_graph = TaskWorkflowGraph(memory_client=memory_client)
final_state = await task_graph.execute(
    task_description=task_description,
    context=task_context,
    user_id=user_id,
    project_id=project_id
)
```
