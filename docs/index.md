# Claude Multi-Agent PM Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for Claude Multi-Agent PM - a revolutionary framework for orchestrating AI agents to manage complex software projects.

## What is Claude Multi-Agent PM?

Claude Multi-Agent PM is a sophisticated orchestration framework that coordinates multiple specialized AI agents to handle different aspects of project management and software development. Instead of relying on a single AI to handle everything, our framework delegates tasks to specialized agents, each expert in their domain.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Coordinate specialized agents for different tasks
- **Intelligent Task Delegation**: Automatically route work to the right agent
- **Comprehensive Project Management**: From planning to deployment
- **Extensible Architecture**: Add custom agents for your specific needs
- **Built-in Best Practices**: Industry-standard workflows out of the box
