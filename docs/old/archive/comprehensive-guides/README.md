# Comprehensive Guides Archive

**Purpose**: Historical comprehensive guides (01-12 series) that provided detailed framework coverage

## Contents

This directory contains the numbered comprehensive guides that were previously in the main docs/ directory. These guides provided extensive coverage of all framework aspects but created cognitive overload for users seeking essential information.

### Why These Were Archived

- **Cognitive Overload**: 12 comprehensive guides were overwhelming for users seeking specific information
- **Information Fragmentation**: Essential information was scattered across multiple guides
- **Overlapping Content**: Many guides contained duplicate or similar information
- **Navigation Complexity**: Too many comprehensive guides made it difficult to find information quickly
