**Resolution Status**: resolved

## Enhancement Summary

Successfully integrated Claude PM Framework backlog information into ticketing agent instructions, completing the framework/CLAUDE.md reorganization initiative.

## Changes Made

### 1. Framework Backlog Integration Section Added
- **Location**: `/Users/masa/Projects/claude-multiagent-pm/tasks/`
- **CLI Integration**: Primary discovery via `aitrackdown help`
- **Framework Structure**: Complete directory hierarchy documentation
- **Cross-Project Coordination**: Framework-aware workflows

### 2. Enhanced Agent Authority
- Added framework backlog management to exclusive permissions
- Included CLI command discovery authority
- Framework-specific ticketing operations

### 3. Platform Support Enhancement
- Added "Claude PM Framework" as specialized platform
- Framework backlog as specialized ticketing context
- Universal ticketing interface integration

### 4. Workflow Integration
- Framework-specific ticket creation workflows
- Framework-aware status management
- Cross-project coordination capabilities

```

### CLI Command Discovery
- Primary method: `aitrackdown help`
- Framework commands: `./bin/aitrackdown`, `./bin/atd`, global `aitrackdown`
- Command delegation and execution patterns

## Integration Benefits

### 1. Specialized Context Handling
- Framework backlog as specialized ticketing context
- Integration with multi-project orchestration
- Framework-aware ticket lifecycle management

### 2. Enhanced Universal Interface
- Framework backlog operations integrate with universal ticketing
- Specialized handling for framework deployment
- Cross-project coordination capabilities

### 3. Improved Workflow Efficiency
- Framework-specific templates and categorization
- Framework-aware status transitions
- Integration with framework deployment states

## Operational Impact

### Positive Outcomes
- ✅ Ticketing agent now has complete framework backlog authority
- ✅ Framework-specific workflows properly documented
- ✅ CLI integration strategy clearly defined
- ✅ Universal ticketing interface enhanced with framework context

### Quality Improvements
- ✅ Specialized context handling for framework operations
- ✅ Enhanced cross-project coordination capabilities
- ✅ Framework-aware analytics and reporting
- ✅ Improved workflow automation for framework tasks

## Follow-up Actions

1. **Validation**: Test framework backlog integration with actual ticketing operations
2. **Training**: Ensure PM understands enhanced ticketing agent capabilities
3. **Documentation**: Update any related documentation referencing framework backlog
4. **Performance**: Monitor framework backlog operations for optimization opportunities

## Architecture Decision Record

**Decision**: Move framework backlog information from main CLAUDE.md to specialized ticketing agent instructions

**Rationale**: 
- Framework backlog is specialized ticketing context
- Ticketing agent has exclusive authority over ticket operations
- Universal ticketing interface should handle framework-specific contexts
- Improves separation of concerns and agent specialization

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Keep in main CLAUDE.md (rejected: creates duplication)
- Create separate framework agent (rejected: increases complexity)
- Distribute across multiple agents (rejected: unclear responsibility)

**Impact**: Enhanced ticketing agent capabilities with framework-specific context while maintaining universal interface principles.
