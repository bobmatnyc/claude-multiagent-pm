# NPM Postinstall Script Debug Report
## Generated: 2025-07-14T08:15:00Z

## INVESTIGATION FINDINGS

### ✅ POSTINSTALL SCRIPT IS WORKING CORRECTLY
- **NPM postinstall script EXECUTES during both global and local installs**
- **All framework components are deployed successfully to ~/.claude-pm/**
- **Installation validation passes all checks**
- **Framework deployment automation is functioning as designed**

### ❌ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: VERSION FILE SYNCHRONIZATION ISSUE

#### The Problem
The postinstall script is working perfectly, but the VERSION files being deployed are outdated:

1. **Package Version**: v0.7.2 (correct, from package.json)
2. **Source bin/VERSION**: 1.0.1 (outdated)
3. **Source framework/VERSION**: 0.1.1 (outdated)
4. **Deployed bin/VERSION**: 1.0.1 (copied from outdated source)
5. **Deployed framework/VERSION**: 0.1.1 (copied from outdated source)

#### Impact
- claude-pm CLI reports old versions
- Framework health checks show version mismatches
- User sees "framework deployment failed" when it actually succeeded
- Version validation fails even though components are deployed

## TECHNICAL EVIDENCE

### NPM Postinstall Execution Proof
```bash
# Manual test shows postinstall running successfully
npm install -g . --verbose
# Output shows: npm info run @bobmatnyc/claude-multiagent-pm@0.7.2 postinstall
```

### Framework Deployment Success
```bash
# All components deployed correctly
ls -la ~/.claude-pm/
# Shows: agents, bin, cli, config, docs, framework, schemas, scripts, templates

# Installation validation passes
cat ~/.claude-pm/config.json
# Shows: "installationComplete": true
```

### Version File Discrepancy
```bash
# Package version (correct)
cat package.json | grep version
# "version": "0.7.2"

# Source VERSION files (outdated)
cat bin/VERSION        # 1.0.1
cat framework/VERSION  # 0.1.1

# Deployed VERSION files (copied from outdated source)
cat ~/.claude-pm/bin/VERSION                # 1.0.1
cat ~/.claude-pm/framework/framework/VERSION # 0.1.1
```

## SOLUTION REQUIRED

### Fix Version File Synchronization
The postinstall script needs to:
1. **Read the actual package version from package.json**
2. **Update VERSION files before deployment**
3. **Ensure deployed versions match package version**

### Immediate Workaround
Users can manually update VERSION files:
```bash
# Fix bin VERSION
echo "0.7.2" > ~/.claude-pm/bin/VERSION

# Fix framework VERSION
echo "0.7.2" > ~/.claude-pm/framework/framework/VERSION
```

## MEMORY COLLECTION

### Error Category: Integration Bug
- **Type**: Version synchronization failure
- **Scope**: NPM package deployment
- **Impact**: User experience degradation
- **Resolution**: Version file automation needed

### Key Insights
1. **NPM postinstall automation works correctly**
2. **Framework deployment succeeds**
3. **Version file management is the bottleneck**
4. **User perception of "failed deployment" is due to version mismatch**

### Recommended Actions
1. **Update bin/VERSION and framework/VERSION in source**
2. **Enhance postinstall script to sync versions from package.json**
3. **Add version validation to deployment process**
4. **Improve error messaging to distinguish version mismatches from deployment failures**

## CONCLUSION

The NPM postinstall script is NOT broken - it's working perfectly. The issue is outdated VERSION files in the source code that give users incorrect version information, making them think the deployment failed when it actually succeeded.

**Priority**: Fix version file synchronization to improve user experience and eliminate false deployment failure indicators.
