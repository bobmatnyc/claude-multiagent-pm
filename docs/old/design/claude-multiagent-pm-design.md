# Claude Multi-Agent PM Framework - Design Document

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Vision and Mission

**Vision**: To create the world's most intelligent and adaptive AI-assisted project management framework that learns from every interaction, adapts to team patterns, and continuously improves development productivity through memory-augmented multi-agent orchestration.

**Mission**: Deliver a zero-configuration, memory-augmented project management platform that orchestrates specialized AI agents to transform complex development workflows into intelligent, automated, and continuously improving processes.

### 1.2 Core Problem Being Solved

The Claude Multi-Agent PM Framework addresses the fundamental challenge of **intelligent AI-assisted project management** by solving:

1. **Context Loss**: Traditional AI interactions lose context between sessions, requiring repetitive explanations
2. **Coordination Complexity**: Managing multiple AI agents without sophisticated orchestration leads to inconsistent results
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Teams repeatedly solve similar problems without capturing and reusing successful patterns
