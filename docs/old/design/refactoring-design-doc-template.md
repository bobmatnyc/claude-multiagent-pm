## Template Usage Instructions

1. **Copy this template** for each refactoring initiative
2. **Fill in all sections** before starting work
3. **Get team review** of the design before implementation
4. **Update status** as work progresses
5. **Document lessons learned** at completion

**Pro Tips:**
- Be specific about file paths and line counts
- Include code examples for complex changes
- Consider backward compatibility early
- Plan for rollback scenarios
- Keep scope focused and achievable
