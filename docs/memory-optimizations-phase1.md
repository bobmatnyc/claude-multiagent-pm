# Phase 1 Memory Optimizations - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the Phase 1 memory optimizations implemented to address critical P0 memory issues in the Claude PM Framework, particularly the Node.js heap exhaustion (8GB in 6.5 minutes).

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. SharedPromptCache Memory Improvements
**File**: `claude_pm/services/shared_prompt_cache.py`

- **Reduced TTL**: Changed from 30 minutes to 5 minutes
  - `default_ttl = 300` (was 1800)
- **Reduced Max Memory**: Changed from 100MB to 50MB
  - `max_memory_mb = 50` (was 100)
- **Reduced Max Entries**: Changed from 1000 to 500
  - `max_size = 500` (was 1000)
- **Faster Cleanup Interval**: Changed from 5 minutes to 1 minute
  - `cleanup_interval = 60` (was 300)
- **Memory Pressure Handling**: Added aggressive cleanup on memory pressure
  - New `handle_memory_pressure()` method
  - Automatic eviction when 80% of memory limit is reached
  - Clears 50% of cache on warning, 75% on critical

### 2. Subprocess Memory Thresholds
**File**: `claude_pm/monitoring/subprocess_manager.py`

- **Reduced Per-Process Limit**: 1GB (was 1.5GB)
  - `subprocess_memory_limit_mb = 1000`
- **Added Warning Threshold**: 500MB (new)
  - `memory_warning_threshold_mb = 500`
- **Added Aggregate Limit**: 2GB for all subprocesses (new)
  - `aggregate_memory_limit_mb = 2000`
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Tracks aggregate memory usage and terminates highest consumers when limit exceeded

### 3. Global Memory Pressure Coordinator
**File**: `claude_pm/services/memory_pressure_coordinator.py` (new)

- **Centralized Coordination**: Single point for memory pressure response
- **Service Registration**: All singleton services register cleanup handlers
- **Thresholds**:
  - Warning: 70% system memory
  - Critical: 85% system memory
- **Cooldown**: 60 seconds between cleanups to prevent thrashing
- **Integrated Services**:
  - SharedPromptCache
  - MemoryDiagnostics
  - HealthMonitor

### 4. Service-Level Memory Cleanup

#### SharedPromptCache
- Implements `handle_memory_pressure()` async method
- Clears entries based on severity level
- Reports memory freed

#### HealthMonitor
- Clears health reports on memory pressure
- Stops background monitoring on critical pressure
- Minimal memory footprint cleanup

#### MemoryDiagnostics
- Already had `perform_emergency_cleanup()`
- Now integrates with coordinator for system-wide cleanup
- Monitors and triggers coordinated cleanup automatically

## Testing

**Test File**: `tests/test_memory_optimizations.py`

Comprehensive tests verify:
1. SharedPromptCache TTL and memory limits
2. Memory-based eviction behavior
3. Subprocess threshold enforcement
4. Memory pressure coordinator functionality
5. Service integration and cleanup

## Performance Impact

### Expected Improvements:
1. **SharedPromptCache**: 
   - 6x faster cache expiration (5 min vs 30 min)
   - 50% less memory usage per cache
   - Aggressive cleanup prevents unbounded growth

2. **Subprocess Management**:
   - 33% reduction in per-process memory limit
   - Early warning at 500MB prevents runaway processes
   - Aggregate limit prevents total memory exhaustion

3. **Coordinated Cleanup**:
   - System-wide response to memory pressure
   - Prevents individual services from causing heap exhaustion
   - Dynamic adjustment based on system state

## Integration Points

1. **Automatic Cleanup**: Memory diagnostics monitors system and triggers coordinator
2. **Service Registration**: Services register on initialization
3. **Manual Trigger**: Can be called directly via:
   ```python
   from claude_pm.services import get_memory_pressure_coordinator
   coordinator = get_memory_pressure_coordinator()
   await coordinator.handle_memory_pressure()
   ```

## Next Steps (Phase 2+)

1. **Fix Remaining Memory Leaks**:
   - Add size limits to defaultdict/OrderedDict usage
   - Implement weakref for memory-sensitive references
   - Node.js wrapper optimization

2. **Enhanced Monitoring**:
   - Real-time memory usage dashboard
   - Automatic alert on memory pressure
   - Historical tracking and analysis

3. **Advanced Optimization**:
   - Lazy loading of large objects
   - Memory pooling for frequently allocated objects
   - Compression for cached data

## Deployment

These changes are backward compatible and will take effect immediately upon deployment. Services will automatically register with the memory pressure coordinator on startup.
