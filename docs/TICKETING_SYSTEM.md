## Working with the Ticketing System

### IMPORTANT: "Backlog" vs "Todo List"
When users ask about the "backlog", they mean the **Claude PM Framework backlog** located at:
```
/Users/masa/Projects/claude-multiagent-pm/trackdown/BACKLOG.md
```

This is NOT the same as Claude Code's todo list tool. The framework backlog contains 42 tickets for the Claude Max + mem0AI enhancement project (Phase 1 complete).

### For AI Assistants
1. **Always check BACKLOG.md first** - Contains complete current state
2. **Reference ticket IDs correctly** - Use exact format [PREFIX-NUMBER]  
3. **Update ticket status** - Track progress through completion
4. **Link related tickets** - Many tickets have dependencies
5. **Follow priority order** - CRITICAL tickets must be completed first

### Quick Commands for Backlog Review
```bash
# View current sprint status
grep -A20 "## üéØ Current Sprint" /Users/masa/Projects/claude-multiagent-pm/trackdown/BACKLOG.md

# View priority tickets (Phase 1)
grep -A50 "## üöÄ Priority Implementation Tickets" /Users/masa/Projects/claude-multiagent-pm/trackdown/BACKLOG.md

# View all MEM tickets
grep "MEM-" /Users/masa/Projects/claude-multiagent-pm/trackdown/BACKLOG.md
```

### Ticket Status Tracking
- **[ ]** Pending/Not Started
- **[x]** Completed 
- **üîÑ** In Progress (use when actively working)
- **üö´** Blocked (with blocker explanation)

### Story Points System
- 1-3 points: Simple tasks (few hours)
- 5-8 points: Standard tasks (1-2 days) 
- 10-13 points: Complex tasks (3-5 days)
- 20+ points: Epic tasks (break down further)

## Integration with mem0AI Enhancement

The ticketing system incorporates memory-driven development with pure subprocess delegation where:
- Past successful task decompositions inform new subprocess patterns
- Memory patterns guide delegation strategy selection
- Continuous learning improves task coordination
- Cross-project knowledge amplifies team effectiveness
- Pure delegation model eliminates workflow complexity

This transforms Claude PM into an **intelligent learning system** with clean subprocess coordination that improves with every completed ticket.
