- `/Users/masa/Projects/Claude-PM/framework/` - Core framework implementation
- `/Users/masa/Projects/managed/` - Individual managed projects

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1 (Current Priority)
Focus on the 6 critical MEM-XXX tickets (52 story points total):
1. Establish core mem0AI integration with OpenAI API
2. Design memory schema for projects, patterns, teams, and errors  
3. Implement 10-agent ecosystem with memory augmentation
4. Create parallel execution framework (max 5 concurrent agents)
5. Build intelligent task decomposition using memory patterns
6. Deploy continuous learning engine for pattern recognition

### Dependencies
- mem0ai service running on port 8002
- OpenAI API access for Claude Max unlimited tokens
- Git worktree infrastructure for agent isolation

## Working with the Ticketing System

### IMPORTANT: "Backlog" vs "Todo List"
When users ask about the "backlog", they mean the **Claude PM Framework backlog** located at:
```
/Users/masa/Projects/Claude-PM/trackdown/BACKLOG.md
```

This is NOT the same as Claude Code's todo list tool. The framework backlog contains 42 active tickets for the Claude Max + mem0AI enhancement project.

### For AI Assistants
1. **Always check BACKLOG.md first** - Contains complete current state
2. **Reference ticket IDs correctly** - Use exact format [PREFIX-NUMBER]  
3. **Update ticket status** - Track progress through completion
4. **Link related tickets** - Many tickets have dependencies
5. **Follow priority order** - CRITICAL tickets must be completed first

### Quick Commands for Backlog Review
```bash
# View current sprint status
grep -A20 "## ðŸŽ¯ Current Sprint" /Users/masa/Projects/Claude-PM/trackdown/BACKLOG.md

# View priority tickets (Phase 1)
grep -A50 "## ðŸš€ Priority Implementation Tickets" /Users/masa/Projects/Claude-PM/trackdown/BACKLOG.md

# View all MEM tickets
grep "MEM-" /Users/masa/Projects/Claude-PM/trackdown/BACKLOG.md
```

### Ticket Status Tracking
- **[ ]** Pending/Not Started
- **[x]** Completed 
- **ðŸ”„** In Progress (use when actively working)
- **ðŸš«** Blocked (with blocker explanation)

### Story Points System
- 1-3 points: Simple tasks (few hours)
- 5-8 points: Standard tasks (1-2 days) 
- 10-13 points: Complex tasks (3-5 days)
- 20+ points: Epic tasks (break down further)

## Integration with mem0AI Enhancement

The ticketing system now incorporates memory-driven development where:
- Past successful decompositions inform new ticket creation
- Memory patterns guide estimation accuracy
- Continuous learning improves future planning
- Cross-project knowledge amplifies team effectiveness

This transform Claude PM from basic orchestration into an **intelligent learning system** that improves with every completed ticket.
