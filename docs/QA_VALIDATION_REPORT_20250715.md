## Issues and Recommendations

### Critical Issues: None

### Minor Issues Identified:

1. **Cross-Process Cache Persistence**

   - **Impact**: Low - each process initializes its own cache efficiently
   - **Recommendation**: Expected behavior for singleton pattern

2. **Error Handling Coverage**
   - **Issue**: Success rate of 83.3% in memory collector
   - **Impact**: Low - error scenarios are properly handled
   - **Recommendation**: Acceptable for test environment

3. **PM Orchestrator Method Compatibility**
   - **Issue**: Some orchestrator methods missing in current implementation
   - **Impact**: Medium - affects advanced orchestration features
   - **Recommendation**: Update orchestrator interface for full compatibility

### Recommendations for Production:

1. **Monitor Memory Collector Success Rate** in production workloads
2. **Implement Enhanced Error Recovery** for critical operations
3. **Add Performance Monitoring Dashboard** for real-time metrics
4. **Complete PM Orchestrator Interface** for full delegation capabilities
