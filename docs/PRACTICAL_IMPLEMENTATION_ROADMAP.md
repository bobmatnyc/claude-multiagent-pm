# Practical Implementation Roadmap

**Document Date**: 2025-07-11  
**Roadmap Type**: Bridge Current Reality to Framework Aspirations  
**Timeline**: 5-Phase Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This roadmap provides a practical path from current Task Tool basic subprocess capabilities to the sophisticated multi-agent orchestration described in framework documentation. The approach prioritizes immediate value delivery while building toward the full framework vision.

## Current State Assessment

### What Works Today ✅
- **Basic Task Delegation**: Task Tool creates subprocess instances
- **Memory Profile Enhancement**: Tested and validated agent specialization
- **Sequential Workflows**: Manual coordination between agents
- **Documentation Structure**: Framework directories and templates exist
- **TodoWrite Integration**: Workflow tracking and coordination

### What's Missing ❌
- **Agent Hierarchy Loading**: No automatic agent detection from directories
- **Context Filtering**: No domain-specific context preparation
- **Cross-Agent Coordination**: No agent-to-agent communication
- **Specialized Agent Types**: No built-in agent differentiation
- **Authority Delegation**: No agent-specific permission systems
