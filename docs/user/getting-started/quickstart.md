## üí¨ Working with Agents - Prompting Examples

### How to Engage Specific Agents

The framework automatically delegates tasks to appropriate agents, but you can also explicitly request specific agent types:

#### Documentation Tasks
```
"Generate comprehensive API documentation for the authentication module"
"Update the README with the new deployment process"
"Create a changelog entry for the latest features"
```

#### Ticketing and Project Management
```
"Create an epic for the user authentication feature"

"Have the Research agent investigate GraphQL best practices, then have the Engineer agent implement those patterns"

"Coordinate with the Security agent to audit the authentication system while the Ops agent prepares the deployment"
```

#### Ticketing-Driven Development with ai-trackdown-tools
```
"Create an epic for the payment processing feature, then break it down into issues and tasks using the Ticketing agent"

"Use the Ticketing agent to track the current sprint progress and update ticket statuses as the Engineer agent completes tasks"

"Coordinate with the Ticketing agent to create a PR for the completed authentication task, then have the QA agent validate it"

"Show me the ticketing hierarchy for the user management epic and create any missing tasks"
```

#### Context-Aware Requests
```
"Based on the current project patterns, implement a user management system that follows our established architectural conventions"

"Using the team's coding standards stored in memory, refactor the payment processing module"

"Analyze the recent deployment issues and implement preventive measures"
```

### Agent Interaction Patterns

The framework uses intelligent delegation patterns:

- **Automatic Agent Selection**: The framework chooses the most appropriate agent based on your request
- **Multi-Agent Workflows**: Complex tasks automatically involve multiple agents in sequence
- **Context Sharing**: Agents share relevant context and learnings across sessions
- **Memory Integration**: Agents remember your preferences and project patterns

### Complete Ticketing Workflow with ai-trackdown-tools

The Ticketing Agent provides a comprehensive workflow using ai-trackdown-tools:

#### 1. Epic Creation and Planning
```
"Create a new epic for implementing user authentication system"
# Agent executes: aitrackdown epic create "User Authentication System"
# Result: Epic created with ID EPK-001
```

#### 2. Issue Breakdown
```
"Break down the authentication epic into specific issues"
# Agent executes: 
# aitrackdown issue create "Design authentication schema" --epic EPK-001
# aitrackdown issue create "Implement JWT middleware" --epic EPK-001
# aitrackdown issue create "Add user registration endpoint" --epic EPK-001
```

#### 3. Task Management
```
"Create detailed tasks for the JWT middleware issue"
# Agent executes:
# aitrackdown task create "Research JWT libraries" --issue ISS-001
# aitrackdown task create "Write JWT token generation" --issue ISS-001
# aitrackdown task create "Add token validation middleware" --issue ISS-001
```

#### 4. Development Workflow Integration
```
"Update task TSK-001 to in-progress and start development"
# Agent executes: aitrackdown update TSK-001 --status "in-progress"
# Then coordinates with Engineer agent for implementation
```

#### 5. PR Creation and Tracking
```
"Create a PR for the completed JWT middleware task"
# Agent executes: aitrackdown pr create "Implement JWT middleware" --task TSK-001
# Links PR to task and updates status automatically
```

#### 6. GitHub Issues Synchronization
```
"Sync the authentication issues to GitHub Issues"
# Agent executes: aitrackdown sync --platform github --filter "authentication"
# Automatically creates corresponding GitHub Issues with proper links
```

#### 7. Status Monitoring
```
"Show me the current status of all authentication-related tickets"
# Agent executes: aitrackdown status --filter "authentication"
# Displays hierarchical view: Epic ‚Üí Issues ‚Üí Tasks ‚Üí PRs
# Shows both local and GitHub Issue status
```

This integration ensures that all development work is properly tracked, organized, and linked through the hierarchical Epic ‚Üí Issue ‚Üí Task ‚Üí PR structure that ai-trackdown-tools provides. **GitHub Issues synchronization** keeps your team aligned by automatically creating corresponding GitHub Issues for seamless integration with your existing workflow.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The framework works with any project structure but creates these directories:

```
your-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .claude-pm/           # Framework configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                 # Documentation (auto-generated)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/                  # Your source code
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md             # Project documentation

# Framework files (in parent directory)
../
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md             # üö® FRAMEWORK FILE - AUTO-GENERATED
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ framework/            # Framework deployment files
```

### Key Files and Directories

#### `CLAUDE.md` (Framework File)
**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: This file is located in the **parent directory** of your project, not in the project itself.

- **Location**: `../CLAUDE.md` (one level up from your project)
- **Purpose**: Contains framework configuration and agent instructions
- **Management**: **AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED** - Do not edit by hand
- **Updates**: The framework updates this file automatically during initialization and operations
- **Scope**: Applies to all projects under the parent directory

**Why it's in the parent directory:**
- Allows the framework to manage multiple projects consistently
- Provides shared configuration across related projects
- Enables the framework to coordinate cross-project operations
- Maintains version control and automatic updates

#### `.claude-pm/` (Project Configuration)
Framework configuration directory containing:
- **Agent configurations**: Project-specific agent settings
- **Project settings**: Local project preferences and overrides
- **Cached data and memories**: Performance optimization and learning data
- **Session state**: Current working state and context

#### Project-Specific Customization

While `CLAUDE.md` is auto-generated, you can create project-specific configuration:

```
your-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .claude-pm/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project-config.json    # Project-specific settings
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agent-overrides.yaml   # Custom agent configurations
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ local-preferences.json # Your personal preferences
```

**Example project-config.json:**
```json
{
  "project_name": "my-web-app",
  "primary_language": "typescript",
  "framework": "react",
  "testing_framework": "jest",
  "coding_standards": "eslint-airbnb",
  "deployment_target": "vercel"
}
```

This local configuration works alongside the framework's auto-generated `CLAUDE.md` to provide project-specific customization without interfering with the framework's operation.

## üîß Configuration

### Basic Configuration
The framework works out-of-the-box with sensible defaults. The main framework configuration is automatically managed:

```bash
# View current configuration
claude-pm config show

# Initialize framework configuration
claude-pm init

# Check framework status
claude-pm status
```

### Project-Specific Configuration
For custom project settings, create local configuration files:

```bash
# Create project-specific settings
mkdir -p .claude-pm
cat > .claude-pm/project-config.json << 'EOF'
{
  "project_name": "my-project",
  "primary_language": "javascript",
  "framework": "express",
  "testing_framework": "mocha",
  "coding_standards": "standard"
}
EOF
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Framework Configuration Warning
**Never edit `../CLAUDE.md` directly** - it's automatically generated and will be overwritten. Instead:

- Use `.claude-pm/project-config.json` for project-specific settings
- Use `.claude-pm/agent-overrides.yaml` for custom agent behavior
- Use `.claude-pm/local-preferences.json` for personal preferences
