  - `MemoryServiceRecovery` class with 4 recovery strategies
  - Automatic health monitoring loop with 30-second intervals
  - Recovery strategies: service health check, configuration validation, connectivity test, ChromaDB persistence verification
  - CLI commands: `claude-pm memory recover` and `claude-pm memory status`
- **Impact**: Memory service can automatically recover from common failure scenarios

## Architecture Components

### Memory Reliability Service (`memory_reliability.py`)
- **MemoryCircuitBreaker**: Protects against cascading failures
- **MemoryServiceRecovery**: Automatic recovery mechanisms
- **MemoryReliabilityService**: Main orchestration service
- **MemoryReliabilityMetrics**: Comprehensive metrics tracking

## Configuration Examples

### ChromaDB Enhanced Configuration
```python
{
    "vector_store": {
        "provider": "chroma",
        "config": {
            "collection_name": "mem0_collection",
            "path": "./chroma_db",
            "persist_directory": "./chroma_db_persist",  # NEW: Data persistence
            "allow_reset": false,                        # NEW: Prevent data loss
            "anonymized_telemetry": false               # NEW: Privacy protection
        }
    }
}
```

### Circuit Breaker Configuration
```python
CircuitBreakerConfig(
    failure_threshold=5,      # Open after 5 failures
    recovery_timeout=60,      # Try recovery after 60 seconds
    success_threshold=3,      # Close after 3 successes
    timeout=30,              # Individual operation timeout
    enabled=True             # Enable circuit breaker
)
```

## Performance Impact

### Reliability Metrics Available
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful operations
- **Failure Rate**: Percentage of failed operations

- Automatic health checks every 30 seconds
- Integration with existing health monitoring infrastructure

## Usage Examples

### Check Memory Service Status
```bash
claude-pm memory status
# Shows: Overall status, circuit breaker state, reliability metrics, recent activity
```

claude-pm memory recover --test-after
# Attempts recovery and runs tests to verify success
```

### Monitor Memory Health
```bash
claude-pm health --service memory --detailed
# Shows memory reliability in unified health dashboard
