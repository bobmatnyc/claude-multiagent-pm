# Research Design Document: Add Real-time Chat Feature

> **Example showing research design doc in practice**

## Overview
**Project Goal**: Add real-time chat feature to existing web application for customer support
**Complexity Level**: Complex (multi-system integration, real-time requirements, security considerations)
**Estimated Timeline**: 3-4 weeks

## Problem Statement
Customer support currently relies on email tickets with 24-48hr response times. Customers want immediate assistance for urgent issues. Support team wants to handle multiple conversations efficiently. Need real-time chat that integrates with existing user authentication and ticket management system.

## Research Questions
1. **Technical approach**: WebSockets vs Server-Sent Events vs WebRTC for real-time communication?
2. **Implementation strategy**: Build custom vs integrate existing chat service (Socket.io, Pusher, Firebase)?
3. **Integration points**: How to connect with existing user auth, ticket system, and support workflow?
4. **Risks/constraints**: Scaling considerations, message persistence, security, moderation needs?

## Technical Analysis

### Current State
- Express.js REST API with JWT authentication
- PostgreSQL database with user and ticket tables
- React frontend with existing support ticket form
- Support team uses admin panel for ticket management

### Proposed Approach
- **Real-time**: Socket.io for WebSocket management with fallback
- **Architecture**: Chat service as separate microservice, shared database
- **Integration**: Extend existing JWT auth, create chat-ticket bridge
- **Persistence**: New chat tables, message history retention policy

### Alternative Approaches Considered
| Approach | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| Custom WebSocket | Full control, no dependencies | Complex scaling, more dev time | ❌ Too much complexity |
| Socket.io service | Proven solution, good scaling | Learning curve, dependency | ✅ Balanced approach |
| Third-party (Intercom) | Fast implementation, proven | Vendor lock-in, cost scaling | ❌ Integration complexity |

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase Breakdown
1. **Phase 1**: Chat backend service (1 week)
   - Socket.io server setup
   - Message persistence
   - JWT integration
2. **Phase 2**: Frontend chat UI (1 week)
   - React chat component
   - Real-time message display
   - Connection management
3. **Phase 3**: Support integration (1 week)
   - Admin chat interface
   - Ticket creation from chat
   - Notification system
4. **Phase 4**: Production deployment (0.5 week)
   - Load testing
   - Production monitoring
   - Documentation

### Risk Assessment
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| WebSocket scaling issues | High | Start with single server, plan horizontal scaling |
| Message storage growth | Medium | Implement retention policy, archive old messages |
| Real-time performance | High | Performance testing, connection limits |
| Auth integration complexity | Medium | Extend existing JWT system, minimal changes |

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Support agents can handle 3+ concurrent chats efficiently
- [ ] Message delivery <200ms for 95% of messages
- [ ] Chat-to-ticket conversion works seamlessly
- [ ] 500+ concurrent users supported
- [ ] Zero data loss during normal operations

## Dependencies & Constraints
- **Technical Dependencies**: Socket.io, Redis for scaling, PostgreSQL schema changes
- **Resource Constraints**: 1 developer, existing sprint commitments
- **External Dependencies**: Design review for chat UI, security review for message storage

## Next Steps
1. **Research complete**: Validate Socket.io approach with small proof-of-concept
2. **Architecture review**: Present integration plan to team for feedback
3. **Sprint planning**: Break phases into 2-week sprint tasks
