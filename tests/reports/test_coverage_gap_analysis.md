### Tier 2: High-Value Targets
Services with existing partial coverage that can be completed:

1. **core/enhanced_base_service.py** (377 lines, 0% coverage)
2. **services/agent_profile_loader.py** (527 lines, 0% coverage)
3. **services/agent_lifecycle_manager.py** (399 lines, 0% coverage)
4. **cli/enhanced_claude_pm_cli.py** (356 lines, 0% coverage)
5. **services/version_control/semantic_versioning.py** (369 lines, 0% coverage)

### Tier 3: CLI Components
All CLI components have 0% coverage:

1. **cli_flags.py** (272 lines)
2. **cli_enforcement.py** (243 lines)
3. **cli_deployment_integration.py** (140 lines)
4. **cli_enhanced_flags.py** (75 lines)

## Strategic Testing Approach

### Phase 1: Core Services Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
**Goal**: Reach 25% coverage by testing critical services

1. Test UnifiedCoreService integration
2. Test parent_directory_manager.py
3. Test agent_registry and agent_registry_sync.py
4. Test hook_processing_service.py

**Expected Coverage**: 4.54% → ~25%

### Phase 2: Orchestration & CLI (Weeks 3-4)
**Goal**: Reach 45% coverage by adding orchestration and CLI tests

1. Test backwards_compatible_orchestrator.py
2. Test all CLI modules
3. Test agent lifecycle management
4. Test version control services

**Expected Coverage**: 25% → ~45%

### Phase 3: Remaining Services (Weeks 5-6)
**Goal**: Reach 65% coverage by completing service tests

1. Test prompt management services
2. Test evaluation and monitoring services
3. Test integration services
4. Test utility functions

**Expected Coverage**: 45% → ~65%

### Phase 4: Edge Cases & Integration (Weeks 7-8)
**Goal**: Reach 80% coverage with integration tests

1. Add integration tests for multi-service workflows
2. Add edge case testing
3. Add error handling tests
4. Complete branch coverage

**Expected Coverage**: 65% → 80%

## Testing Patterns and Infrastructure

### Existing Test Structure
- **Unit Tests**: Located in `tests/unit/`
- **Integration Tests**: Located in `tests/integration/`
- **E2E Tests**: Located in `tests/e2e/`
- **Test Utilities**: Available in `tests/utils/`

### Recommended Testing Patterns

1. **Service Testing Pattern**:
```python
class TestServiceName:
    @pytest.fixture
    def service(self):
        return ServiceClass()
    
    def test_initialization(self, service):
        assert service is not None
    
    def test_core_functionality(self, service):
        # Test main service methods
        pass
    
    def test_error_handling(self, service):
        # Test error cases
        pass
```

2. **Mock Strategy**:
- Use unittest.mock for external dependencies
- Create fixtures for commonly mocked services
- Test both success and failure paths

3. **Coverage Requirements**:
- Minimum 80% line coverage per module
- Focus on branch coverage for complex logic
- Integration tests for service interactions

## Effort Estimation

### Total Effort: 8 weeks (2 developers)

| Phase | Duration | Coverage Goal | Key Deliverables |
|-------|----------|---------------|------------------|
| Phase 1 | 2 weeks | 25% | Core services tested |
| Phase 2 | 2 weeks | 45% | Orchestration & CLI tested |
| Phase 3 | 2 weeks | 65% | All services tested |
| Phase 4 | 2 weeks | 80% | Integration & edge cases |

### Resource Requirements
- 2 senior developers familiar with the framework
- CI/CD pipeline updates for coverage reporting
- Code review process for test quality

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Start with Core Services**: Focus on services that other components depend on
2. **Test Public APIs First**: Ensure all public interfaces are tested
3. **Mock External Dependencies**: Isolate tests from external systems
4. **Maintain Test Quality**: Ensure tests are meaningful, not just coverage-driven
5. **Continuous Integration**: Run tests on every commit

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Set up coverage reporting in CI/CD
   - Create test templates and utilities
   - Begin Phase 1 with UnifiedCoreService tests

2. **Week 1 Goals**:
   - Complete UnifiedCoreService tests
   - Start parent_directory_manager tests
   - Establish testing patterns

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Daily coverage reports
   - Weekly progress reviews
   - Adjust strategy based on findings

## Conclusion

Achieving 80% test coverage is achievable within 8 weeks with focused effort. The key is to prioritize high-impact services that provide core functionality and work systematically through the codebase. Testing the top 5 service modules alone would increase coverage to approximately 60%, making the 80% target realistic with additional effort on remaining components.
