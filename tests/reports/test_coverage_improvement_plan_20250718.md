# Claude PM Framework Test Coverage Improvement Plan

**Date**: 2025-07-18  
**Current Coverage**: 4.54%  
**Target Coverage**: 80%  
**Framework Version**: 0.7.0  
**Timeline**: 8 weeks (with milestones)  

## Executive Summary

This plan provides a structured, milestone-based approach to improve test coverage from 4.54% to 80% within 8 weeks. The plan focuses on high-impact services first, with weekly milestones and specific deliverables. Each phase includes concrete test tasks that can be immediately implemented.

## Test Coverage Milestones

### Week 1-2: Foundation Sprint (Target: 25% Coverage)
**Focus**: Core services that other components depend on

### Week 3-4: Integration Sprint (Target: 45% Coverage)
**Focus**: Orchestration, CLI, and service integration

### Week 5-6: Completion Sprint (Target: 65% Coverage)
**Focus**: Remaining services and utilities

### Week 7-8: Quality Sprint (Target: 80% Coverage)
**Focus**: Edge cases, branch coverage, and integration tests

## Testing Standards and Patterns

### 1. Test File Organization
```
tests/
├── unit/           # Isolated unit tests
│   ├── services/   # One test file per service
│   ├── core/       # Core functionality tests
│   └── cli/        # CLI component tests
├── integration/    # Multi-component tests
│   ├── workflows/  # End-to-end workflows
│   └── services/   # Service interaction tests
└── e2e/           # Full system tests
```

### 2. Standard Test Template
```python
"""Test module for [ComponentName].

Tests cover:
- Initialization and configuration
- Core functionality
- Error handling and edge cases
- Integration points
"""
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch
from claude_pm.services.component_name import ComponentClass

class TestComponentName:
    """Test suite for ComponentName."""
    
    @pytest.fixture
    def component(self):
        """Create component instance for testing."""
        return ComponentClass()
    
    @pytest.fixture
    def mock_dependencies(self):
        """Mock external dependencies."""
        return {
            'dependency1': Mock(),
            'dependency2': Mock()
        }
    
    # Initialization Tests
    def test_initialization_default(self, component):
        """Test default initialization."""
        assert component is not None
        assert component.property == expected_value
    
    def test_initialization_with_config(self):
        """Test initialization with custom config."""
        config = {'key': 'value'}
        component = ComponentClass(config)
        assert component.config == config
    
    # Core Functionality Tests
    def test_main_functionality(self, component, mock_dependencies):
        """Test primary component function."""
        with patch('module.dependency', mock_dependencies['dependency1']):
            result = component.main_function()
            assert result == expected_result
    
    # Error Handling Tests
    def test_handles_invalid_input(self, component):
        """Test error handling for invalid input."""
        with pytest.raises(ValueError):
            component.process(None)
    
    # Integration Tests
    @pytest.mark.integration
    def test_integrates_with_service(self, component):
        """Test integration with other services."""
        # Integration test implementation
        pass
```

### 3. Testing Guidelines

#### Coverage Requirements
- **Line Coverage**: Minimum 80% per module
- **Branch Coverage**: Minimum 70% for complex logic
- **Error Paths**: All error conditions must be tested
- **Public APIs**: 100% coverage for public interfaces

#### Mock Strategy
```python
# Preferred mocking approach
@patch('claude_pm.services.external_service')
def test_with_mock(mock_service):
    mock_service.return_value = expected_data
    # Test implementation

# Fixture-based mocking for reusability
@pytest.fixture
def mock_api_client():
    with patch('claude_pm.utils.api_client') as mock:
        mock.fetch.return_value = {'status': 'success'}
        yield mock
```

#### Async Testing Pattern
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_async_functionality():
    service = AsyncService()
    result = await service.async_method()
    assert result == expected_value
```

## Testing Infrastructure Setup

### 1. Coverage Configuration
```ini
# tests/config/pytest.ini additions
[tool:pytest]
addopts = 
    --cov=claude_pm
    --cov-report=html
    --cov-report=term-missing
    --cov-fail-under=80
    --cov-branch

[coverage:run]
branch = True
omit = 
    */tests/*
    */migrations/*
    */__init__.py

[coverage:report]
precision = 2
show_missing = True
```

### 2. CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/test-coverage.yml
name: Test Coverage
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  coverage:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run tests with coverage
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements/test.txt
          pytest --cov=claude_pm --cov-report=xml
      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v1
        with:
          file: ./coverage.xml
          fail_ci_if_error: true
```

### 3. Test Utilities
```python
# tests/utils/test_helpers.py
def create_mock_service(service_class):
    """Create a properly mocked service instance."""
    pass

def assert_async_raises(exception, coro):
    """Assert async function raises exception."""
    pass

def create_test_config():
    """Create standard test configuration."""
    pass
```

## Success Metrics

### Weekly Checkpoints
- **Week 1**: 15% coverage, core services tested
- **Week 2**: 25% coverage, service ecosystem complete
- **Week 3**: 35% coverage, orchestration tested
- **Week 4**: 45% coverage, agent system complete
- **Week 5**: 55% coverage, all services basic tests
- **Week 6**: 65% coverage, deep service coverage
- **Week 7**: 73% coverage, integration complete
- **Week 8**: 80% coverage, quality assured

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Execution Time**: < 5 minutes for full suite
- **Test Reliability**: 0% flaky tests
- **Mock Coverage**: All external dependencies mocked
- **Documentation**: All tests have docstrings

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Legacy Code**: Some services may be difficult to test
   - Mitigation: Refactor where necessary, document untestable code
   
2. **External Dependencies**: Services with many external calls
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive mocking strategy
   
3. **Async Complexity**: Many async operations
   - Mitigation: Use pytest-asyncio, establish async test patterns

4. **Time Constraints**: 8-week timeline is aggressive
   - Mitigation: Focus on high-impact tests first, defer edge cases

## Conclusion

This plan provides a realistic path to 80% test coverage within 8 weeks. By focusing on high-impact services first and following established testing patterns, we can systematically improve coverage while maintaining test quality. The week-by-week breakdown with specific tasks ensures measurable progress toward our goal.

**Next Steps**:
1. Approve the plan and allocate resources
2. Set up coverage tracking in CI/CD
3. Begin Week 1 implementation immediately
4. Schedule weekly progress reviews

**Remember**: Quality over quantity - meaningful tests that catch real bugs are more valuable than tests written solely for coverage metrics.
