# UnifiedCoreService Test Coverage Summary

## Achievement: 100% Coverage ✅

Created comprehensive tests for the UnifiedCoreService module, achieving complete coverage.

### Test File: `tests/unit/services/test_unified_core_service.py`

### Coverage Results:

### Test Classes Created:

1. **TestUnifiedCoreService** - Main test class covering:
   - Initialization and lazy loading
   - Service caching behavior  
   - Error handling for unknown services
   - All property accessors (12 tested)
   - Service information retrieval
   - Service lifecycle management
   - Concurrent access handling
   - Edge cases and boundary conditions

2. **TestUnifiedCoreServiceExports** - Module export tests:
   - Validates __all__ definition
   - Ensures all service classes are properly exported
   - Verifies singleton instance export

### Key Testing Patterns Used:

1. **Comprehensive Mocking**: Created mock service classes for all 32 services
2. **Fixture-based Setup**: Used pytest fixtures for reusable test configuration
3. **Lazy Loading Verification**: Ensured services are only instantiated when accessed
4. **Caching Validation**: Verified same instance returned on multiple accesses
5. **Error Scenario Coverage**: Tested all error paths and edge cases
6. **Thread Safety**: Included concurrent access testing

### Test Scenarios Covered:

- ✅ Normal initialization and service access
- ✅ Lazy loading on first access
- ✅ Multiple access returns same instance
- ✅ Error cases (service initialization failures)
- ✅ Unknown service name handling
- ✅ Service information retrieval
- ✅ Complete service lifecycle
- ✅ Concurrent access from multiple threads
- ✅ Edge cases (empty strings, None values, case sensitivity)

### Total Tests: 16
### All Tests: PASSING ✅
