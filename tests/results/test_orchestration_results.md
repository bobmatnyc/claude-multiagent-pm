# Orchestration Test Results

## Test Summary

### ✅ Agent Loading Tests
- **Documentation agent**: Successfully using local orchestration
- **Engineer agent**: Successfully using local orchestration  
- **QA agent**: Successfully using local orchestration
- **Research agent**: Successfully using local orchestration
- **Security agent**: Successfully using local orchestration
- **Version Control agent**: Successfully using local orchestration

### ✅ Cache Functionality
- Caching is working correctly
- Second delegation was noticeably faster than the first
- Agent prompts are being cached after first load

### ✅ Error Handling
- Non-existent agents gracefully fall back to subprocess mode with error note
- Empty agent types are handled without crashes

### ✅ Context Manager
- Context filtering is working for all agent types
- Each agent type receives filtered context appropriate to their role
- Context size reduction is happening as expected

## Key Findings

1. **Local Orchestration Working**: After fixing the bugs in `backwards_compatible_orchestrator.py`, local orchestration is now successfully working for all core agent types.

2. **Proper Fallback**: When agent prompts can't be loaded (e.g., for non-existent agents), the system correctly falls back to subprocess mode.

3. **Performance**: The caching system is reducing load times on subsequent agent delegations.

4. **Context Filtering**: The ContextManager is successfully filtering context based on agent type, reducing the context size appropriately.

## Fixed Issues

1. **Missing context collection**: Added proper calls to `_collect_filtered_context` 
2. **Incorrect cache method calls**: Fixed to use correct SharedPromptCache API
3. **Missing imports**: Added necessary imports for ContextManager, etc.
4. **Method signature mismatches**: Fixed all method calls to use correct parameters

## Configuration Required

For local orchestration to be enabled, the `CLAUDE.md` file must contain:
```
<!-- CLAUDE_PM_ORCHESTRATION: ENABLED -->
```

## Test Command

To run the tests:
```bash
python test_orchestration_manual.py
```

## Next Steps

1. The fixes in `backwards_compatible_orchestrator.py` should be committed
2. Consider adding automated tests to the test suite
3. Update documentation to explain local orchestration configuration
4. Monitor performance metrics in production usage
