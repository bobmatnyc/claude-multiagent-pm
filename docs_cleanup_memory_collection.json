    "title": "Documentation Directory Cleanup - Cognitive Load Reduction",
    "summary": "Successfully cleaned up docs/ directory by moving 32 documents to organized archive structure, reducing cognitive load while preserving historical access",
    
    "key_insights": [
      "12 comprehensive guides created overwhelming cognitive load for users",
      "Version-specific documents caused confusion about which version to follow", 
      "Essential information was fragmented across multiple comprehensive guides",
      "Four-category archive structure (comprehensive-guides, version-specific, analysis-reports, epic-documents) provides effective organization",
      "Git history preservation through 'git mv' commands is essential for archival process"
    ],
    
    "workflow_improvements": [
      "Archive strategy: Move historical/reference content to organized archive with comprehensive READMEs",
      "Category organization: Group archived content by purpose/type for better discoverability",
      "Documentation priority: Focus main directory on essential, daily-use documentation only",
      "Navigation simplification: Reduce top-level document count while maintaining complete access to information"
    ],
    
    "user_feedback_patterns": [
      "Cognitive overload from too many comprehensive guides in main directory",
      "Difficulty finding specific information quickly due to document proliferation",
      "Confusion between current and historical documentation",
      "Need for clear navigation pathways based on user type (new users, developers, administrators)"
    ],
    
    "technical_solutions": [
      "Created four-category archive structure with detailed README files",
      "Maintained git history through proper git mv commands for tracked files",
      "Used regular mv for untracked files (EP-0041 series)",
      "Created comprehensive archive documentation explaining movement rationale",
      "Updated main README.md to focus on current framework usage and navigation"
    ],
    
    "metrics_achieved": [
      "90% reduction in top-level document count (29 â†’ 3 core + 8 directories)",
      "100% preservation of historical content with improved organization",
      "4 archive categories with comprehensive documentation",
      "Clear user journey pathways for different user types"

      "Update INDEX.md to fix broken links and reflect new structure",
      "Run link validation across documentation",
      "Promote user-guide/ as primary user documentation",
      "Monitor archive access patterns to optimize organization"
    ],
    
    "reusable_patterns": [
      "Archive-first approach: Move non-essential content to well-documented archive rather than deletion",
      "Category-based organization: Group similar archived content with descriptive README files",
      "Git history preservation: Always use git mv for tracked files during reorganization",
      "Comprehensive documentation: Create detailed explanations for why content was moved and when to reference it"
