   - `BaseState`: Foundation with 9 core fields
   - `TaskState`: 21 specialized fields for task execution
   - `ProjectState`: 22 fields for project-level orchestration
   - `CodeReviewState`: Specialized for parallel review workflows

2. **Checkpointing and Persistence**
   - SQLite-based state persistence with custom metrics tables
   - Agent execution tracking with tokens and cost monitoring
   - Performance metrics and memory usage logging
   - Automatic cleanup with configurable retention policies

3. **Workflow Orchestration**
   - LangGraph StateGraph with 7 node types
   - Intelligent complexity-based routing
   - Memory context integration points
   - Human approval workflow support

4. **Configuration and Monitoring**
   - YAML-based configuration with fallback defaults

## Risk Assessment

### âœ… Mitigated Risks
- **Performance**: Excellent benchmarks achieved
- **Integration**: All components work together seamlessly  
- **Scalability**: Modular architecture supports growth
- **Maintenance**: Comprehensive test coverage ensures stability

### ðŸŸ¡ Minor Considerations for Future
- Checkpointer interface may need updates for newer LangGraph versions
- Memory integration requires mem0AI service to be running
- Configuration validation could be enhanced with schema checking

## Conclusion

LGR-001 successfully establishes a robust, scalable foundation for LangGraph integration within Claude PM Framework. All acceptance criteria exceeded expectations, performance benchmarks are excellent, and the multi-agent orchestration approach proved highly effective.

The infrastructure is now ready to support:
- **LGR-002**: Advanced agent node implementations
