## **[TASK-ID]** Task Title - Brief Description

**Type**: Implementation/Feature/Bug Fix/Enhancement  
**Phase**: Phase 1/2/3  
**Week**: Week X  
**Priority**: Critical/High/Medium/Low  
**Story Points**: X  
**Assignee**: @implementer  
**Status**: Ready/In Progress/Testing/Completed  
**Dependencies**: [Previous task IDs]

**Description:**
Clear description of what needs to be implemented, including business context and technical requirements.

**Technical Requirements:**
- Specific technical requirement 1
- Specific technical requirement 2
- Integration requirement
- Performance requirement

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Functional requirement 1 implemented and tested
- [ ] Functional requirement 2 implemented and tested
- [ ] Performance target met (specify metric)
- [ ] Integration working with component X
- [ ] 95%+ test coverage for new code
- [ ] Code quality standards met (linting, typing, formatting)

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **Step 1**: Initial setup and scaffolding
2. **Step 2**: Core functionality implementation
3. **Step 3**: Testing and validation
4. **Step 4**: Integration and optimization
5. **Step 5**: Documentation and completion

**Technical Details:**
```language
# Example code structure or interface
class ComponentName:
    def method_name(self, param: Type) -> ReturnType:
        """Method description and requirements."""
        pass
```

**Testing Requirements:**
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and functions
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Test interaction with other components
- [ ] **Performance Tests**: Validate performance requirements
- [ ] **Edge Case Tests**: Test boundary conditions and error handling

**Testing Approach:**
```bash
# Test commands to run
test_command_for_unit_tests
test_command_for_integration_tests
test_command_for_performance_validation
```

**Performance Targets:**
- **Metric 1**: Target value and measurement method
- **Metric 2**: Performance threshold and validation
- **Resource Usage**: Memory/CPU limits

**Dependencies:**
- **Prerequisite Tasks**: [TASK-001], [TASK-002]
- **External Dependencies**: Libraries, services, or tools needed
- **File Dependencies**: Specific files or modules that must exist

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `src/path/to/component.ext` - Main implementation
- `tests/unit/test_component.ext` - Unit tests
- `tests/integration/test_component_integration.ext` - Integration tests
- `docs/api/component.md` - API documentation (if applicable)

**Configuration Changes:**
- Configuration file updates needed
- Environment variable additions
- Dependency additions to package configuration

**Integration Points:**
- **Component A**: How this task integrates with existing component A
- **Component B**: Integration requirements with component B
- **External Services**: API integrations or external service connections

**Risk Assessment:**
- **High Risk**: Potential blockers and mitigation strategies
- **Medium Risk**: Challenges that may impact timeline
- **Low Risk**: Minor issues with known workarounds

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified
- [ ] Code implemented following project standards
- [ ] Tests written and passing (unit, integration, performance)
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Performance targets achieved
- [ ] Documentation updated (API docs, README, etc.)
- [ ] Integration with existing codebase working
- [ ] No regressions introduced

**Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] All linting checks pass
- [ ] Type checking passes (if applicable)
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced
- [ ] Error handling implemented properly
- [ ] Logging added where appropriate

**Documentation Requirements:**
- [ ] Code comments for complex logic
- [ ] Docstrings for public APIs
- [ ] Usage examples provided
- [ ] API documentation updated
- [ ] README updated if needed

**Validation Steps:**
1. **Functional Testing**: Verify all features work as expected
2. **Performance Testing**: Validate performance targets are met
3. **Integration Testing**: Ensure compatibility with existing system
4. **Regression Testing**: Confirm no existing functionality is broken
5. **Code Review**: Peer review of implementation and tests

**Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] Implementation complete and working
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Performance validated
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Ready for next task dependencies

**Notes:**
- Implementation notes and considerations
- Links to relevant documentation or specifications
- Special requirements or constraints
