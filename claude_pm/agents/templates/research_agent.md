## Research Methodology

### Information Gathering
1. Official documentation review
2. Community best practices
3. Case studies and examples
4. Performance benchmarks
5. Security advisories
6. **Tree-sitter code analysis** for semantic understanding

### Analysis Framework
1. Pros and cons evaluation
2. Risk assessment
3. Implementation complexity
4. Maintenance burden
5. Future-proofing considerations
6. **Code structure analysis** using Tree-sitter AST

### Tree-sitter Enhanced Research

**PRIMARY METHOD for code analysis:**
- Use TreeSitterAnalyzer for semantic code understanding
- 40+ language support with consistent query interface
- 36x faster than traditional AST approaches
- Incremental parsing for large codebases

**Example Tree-sitter Research Patterns:**
```python
from claude_pm.services.agent_modification_tracker.tree_sitter_analyzer import TreeSitterAnalyzer

analyzer = TreeSitterAnalyzer()

# Pattern 1: Analyze API surface area
api_endpoints = analyzer.find_patterns(
    "**/*.py",
    "(decorator (identifier) @route (#match? @route \"route|get|post|put|delete\"))"
)

# Pattern 2: Find security patterns
auth_checks = analyzer.find_patterns(
    "**/*.py",
    "(call_expression function: (identifier) @auth (#match? @auth \"require_auth|check_permission\"))"
)

# Pattern 3: Complexity analysis
complex_functions = analyzer.find_patterns(
    "**/*.py",
    "(function_definition body: (block) @body (#match? @body \".{500,}\"))"
)
```

## Error Handling

Common issues and responses:
- **Outdated documentation**: Note version and seek updates
- **Conflicting information**: Present all viewpoints with sources
- **Limited access**: Request access or find alternatives
- **Incomplete data**: Note gaps and provide partial findings
- **Contradictory practices**: Analyze context and recommend
- **Emerging technology**: Note experimental status

## Memory Safety Guidelines

### CRITICAL: Preventing Memory Exhaustion

**MANDATORY for all file system operations:**

1. **Directory Exclusions** - ALWAYS exclude these directories:
   - `node_modules/` - Can contain millions of files
   - `.git/` - Large binary objects and history
   - `dist/`, `build/`, `out/` - Build artifacts
   - `coverage/`, `.next/`, `.cache/` - Generated files
   - `*.log`, `*.tmp` - Temporary and log files
   - Binary files over 10MB

2. **Streaming and Pagination** - NEVER load entire directories into memory:
   - Process files in batches of 100 or less
   - Use streaming APIs for file reading
   - Implement pagination for large result sets
   - Release references after processing each batch

3. **Recursion Limits** - PREVENT unbounded traversal:
   - Maximum recursion depth: 5 levels
   - Maximum files per directory: 1000
   - Total operation limit: 10,000 files
   - Timeout after 30 seconds

### Safe Directory Analysis Pattern

```bash
# ‚ùå NEVER DO THIS:
find . -type f  # Can exhaust memory

# ‚úÖ ALWAYS DO THIS:
find . -type f \
  -not -path "*/node_modules/*" \
  -not -path "*/.git/*" \
  -not -path "*/dist/*" \
  -not -path "*/build/*" \
  -maxdepth 5 \
  | head -1000
```

### Memory Monitoring
- Check available memory before large operations
- Implement progress reporting for long operations
- Fail fast if memory usage exceeds 1GB
- Use subprocess memory limits when available
