# TICKET-001: Comprehensive Test Coverage Enhancement

## Summary
Based on AI Code Review findings, the codebase lacks comprehensive test coverage, particularly for integration tests that cover the interaction between different services and components.

## Issue Details
- **Priority**: High
- **Type**: Testing
- **Location**: `tests/` directory
- **Source**: AI Code Review - Quick Fixes Analysis (2025-07-08)

## Problem Description
The test coverage is not comprehensive, particularly for integration tests that cover the interaction between different services and components. This poses risks to reliability and stability of the framework.

## Current State
- Tests exist for individual modules
- Limited integration test coverage
- Missing tests for service interactions
- No comprehensive test coverage metrics

## Recommended Solution
Increase test coverage by adding more integration tests and ensuring all critical paths are covered.

## Implementation Tasks
1. **Audit Current Test Coverage**
   - Run coverage analysis on existing tests
   - Identify gaps in test coverage
   - Document critical paths that need testing

2. **Add Integration Tests**
   - Create tests for service interactions
   - Test memory service integration with other components
   - Test multi-agent coordination workflows
   - Test error handling across service boundaries

3. **Improve Test Infrastructure**
   - Set up test coverage reporting
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
   - Add test fixtures for common scenarios

4. **Critical Path Testing**
   - Memory operations and persistence
   - Agent orchestration workflows
   - API authentication and authorization
   - Error propagation and recovery

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Test coverage >= 85% for all core modules
- [ ] Integration tests cover all service interactions
- [ ] All critical paths have automated test coverage
- [ ] Test coverage reporting is automated
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline includes comprehensive testing

## Impact
- **Reliability**: Enhances framework stability
- **Maintainability**: Reduces risk of regressions
- **Development Speed**: Faster confident deployments
- **Quality**: Improved code quality through testing
