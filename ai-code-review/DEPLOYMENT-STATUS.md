### Deployment Architecture
```
ai-code-review/
â”œâ”€â”€ Local Development Server (Port 3000)
â”œâ”€â”€ API Endpoints (/api/changes/recent, /api/modal/content)  
â”œâ”€â”€ Change Detection Service (Git monitoring)
â”œâ”€â”€ Content Aggregation (Documentation, releases)
â”œâ”€â”€ Caching Layer (Performance optimization)
â””â”€â”€ Monitoring & Logging (Debug and health checks)
```

### What's New Modal Integration
