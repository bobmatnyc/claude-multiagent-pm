# TICKET-002: Secure API Key Management Implementation

## Summary
Based on AI Code Review findings, API keys are currently stored in environment variables without secure vault or key management services for production environments.

## Issue Details
- **Priority**: High
- **Type**: Security
- **Location**: `claude_pm/integrations/security.py` and `.env` files
- **Source**: AI Code Review - Quick Fixes Analysis (2025-07-08)

## Problem Description
API keys are stored in environment variables, but there is no mention of using secure vaults or key management services for production environments. This poses security risks for sensitive information.

## Current State
- API keys stored in `.env` files
- Environment variable based configuration
- No secure storage for production
- Keys potentially exposed in version control or logs

## Recommended Solution
Implement secure storage solutions for API keys, such as AWS Secrets Manager or Azure Key Vault, especially for production environments.

## Implementation Tasks
1. **Audit Current API Key Usage**
   - Identify all API keys in the system
   - Review current storage mechanisms
   - Assess security risks and exposure points

2. **Implement Secure Storage**
   - Choose secure storage solution (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.)
   - Implement secure key retrieval mechanisms
   - Add environment-specific key management

3. **Update Configuration System**
   - Modify configuration loading to support secure storage
   - Add fallback mechanisms for development environments
   - Implement key rotation capabilities

4. **Security Best Practices**
   - Remove sensitive keys from environment files
   - Add key validation and error handling
   - Implement audit logging for key access
   - Add documentation for secure deployment

## Success Criteria
- [ ] API keys stored in secure vault for production
- [ ] No sensitive keys in environment files
- [ ] Secure key retrieval implemented
- [ ] Key rotation mechanism available
- [ ] Audit logging for key access
- [ ] Documentation for secure deployment

## Impact
- **Security**: Protects sensitive information from unauthorized access
- **Compliance**: Meets security best practices
- **Risk Reduction**: Minimizes exposure of critical credentials
- **Operational**: Enables secure production deployments

## Estimated Effort
- **Size**: Medium (2-3 days)
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Dependencies**: Cloud provider access for secure storage

## Implementation Options
1. **AWS Secrets Manager**
   - Use boto3 for secret retrieval
   - Implement IAM-based access control
   - Add secret rotation capabilities

2. **Azure Key Vault**
   - Use Azure SDK for secret management
   - Implement Azure AD authentication
   - Add secret versioning support

3. **HashiCorp Vault**
   - Use Vault API for secret retrieval
   - Implement token-based authentication
   - Add dynamic secret generation
