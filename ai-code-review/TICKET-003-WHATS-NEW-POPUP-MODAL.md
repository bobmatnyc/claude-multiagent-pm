## Requirements

### Core Features
- Monitor codebase changes (commits, releases, pull requests)
- Check for relevant news/updates from project documentation
- Display as non-intrusive modal dialog
- Auto-hide if no new content available
- Configurable time window (default: 3 days)

### Technical Specifications
- **Frontend**: Modal component with clean, modern design
- **Backend**: Service to aggregate recent changes and news
- **Data Sources**: 
  - Git commit history
  - GitHub releases/tags
  - Project documentation updates
  - News/changelog entries
- **Persistence**: User preferences for dismissal/frequency

### User Experience
- Modal appears on home page load (only if new content exists)
- Easy to dismiss with X button or click outside
- "Don't show again for 24 hours" option
