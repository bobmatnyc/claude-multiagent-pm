  # Task: Validate ai-trackdown CLI Functionality and Fix Indexing Issues

  ## Overview
  Resolve CLI indexing problems and ensure all commands work properly with migrated data.

  ## Current Issues Identified

  ### Indexing Problems
  - [ ] CLI not properly indexing existing epic files
  - [ ] `aitrackdown epic list` returns "No epics found" despite files existing
  - [ ] Issue creation fails with "Epic not found" for valid epic IDs
  - [ ] Index rebuild not consistently finding all markdown files

  ### CLI Commands to Validate
  - [ ] `aitrackdown status` - Should show project overview
  - [ ] `aitrackdown epic list` - Should display all 6 created epics  
  - [ ] `aitrackdown issue list` - Should show 3 migrated issues
  - [ ] `aitrackdown task list` - Should display created tasks
  - [ ] Issue/task creation with proper epic linkage

  ## Investigation Steps

  ### File Structure Validation
  - [x] Confirmed epic files exist in tasks/epics/ with proper naming
  - [x] Verified YAML frontmatter format matches expected schema
  - [ ] Check if file encoding or line endings cause parsing issues
  - [ ] Validate markdown structure and template conformance

  ### Index System Analysis
  - [ ] Examine .ai-trackdown-index file generation and contents
  - [ ] Test manual index rebuild with verbose output
  - [ ] Verify config.yaml settings for directory structure
  - [ ] Debug CLI parsing of markdown frontmatter

  ### CLI Configuration  
  - [ ] Verify tasks_directory setting in config.yaml
  - [ ] Check file path resolution in CLI commands
  - [ ] Test with different directory structures if needed
  - [ ] Validate CLI version compatibility

  ## Technical Investigation

  ### Known Working
  - CLI installation and basic command execution
  - Epic file creation (EP-0009 worked)
  - File structure matches expected format
  - Configuration files properly generated

  ### Suspected Issues
  - Index rebuild not finding pre-existing files
  - Frontmatter parsing problems with specific format
  - File path resolution in CLI commands
  - Cache or state issues with index system

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] All CLI commands work consistently
  - [ ] Epic, issue, and task listing shows accurate data
  - [ ] New item creation works with proper parent linkage
  - [ ] Index rebuild correctly identifies all existing files
  - [ ] Status command provides accurate project overview

  ## Success Metrics
  - [ ] `aitrackdown epic list` shows 6+ epics
  - [ ] `aitrackdown issue list` shows 3+ issues  
  - [ ] `aitrackdown status` provides project overview
  - [ ] New issue creation succeeds with valid epic references
  - [ ] Full CLI workflow functional for daily use

  ## Notes
  **Priority**: HIGH - CLI functionality critical for system adoption
  **Blocker**: Indexing issues preventing proper CLI usage
  **Impact**: Must resolve before declaring migration successful
