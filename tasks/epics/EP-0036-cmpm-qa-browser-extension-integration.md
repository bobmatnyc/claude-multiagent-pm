  # Epic: CMPM-QA Browser Extension Integration


  ## Overview

  CMPM-QA Browser Extension Integration as unified framework component. Integrated deployment within Claude PM Framework
  infrastructure, leveraging existing agent hierarchy, configuration management, and health monitoring systems. Enables
  real-time browser testing through framework-native deployment without standalone services.


  ## Objectives

  - [ ] **Framework-Native Deployment**: Deploy as integrated component within Claude PM Framework (source/npm) without
  Docker requirement

  - [ ] **Unified Health & Status Monitoring**: Integrate with existing framework health checks and CLI monitoring
  systems

  - [ ] **Agent Hierarchy Integration**: Leverage existing multi-agent coordination and orchestration infrastructure

  - [ ] **Configuration Management**: Use framework configuration system for unified setup and management

  - [ ] **Real-Time Browser Testing**: Enable seamless browser automation through framework-native extension bridge


  ## Acceptance Criteria

  - [ ] **Bundled Integration**: CMPM-QA system deployed as integrated framework component, not separate package

  - [ ] **Framework Infrastructure**: Uses existing agent hierarchy, configuration, and monitoring systems

  - [ ] **Unified CLI Integration**: Health checks and status monitoring integrated into framework CLI commands

  - [ ] **No Standalone Services**: Eliminates need for separate Docker containers or standalone deployments

  - [ ] **Memory-Augmented Testing**: Leverages framework's memory integration for intelligent test pattern recognition


  ## Related Issues

  - ISS-0065: CMPM-QA Chrome Extension Development (Framework-Native)

  - ISS-0066: CMPM-QA Local Service Bridge (Framework-Integrated)

  - ISS-0067: QA Agent Browser Testing Integration (Agent Hierarchy)

  - ISS-0068: CMPM-QA Architecture Validation (Framework Architecture)


  ## Framework Integration Strategy


  ### Deployment Architecture

  - **Framework Component**: Integrated within Claude PM Framework as native module

  - **Agent Integration**: Leverages existing MultiAgentOrchestrator for coordination

  - **Configuration**: Uses framework configuration management system

  - **Health Monitoring**: Integrated with framework health checks and CLI status commands


  ### Technology Stack Alignment

  - **Framework Infrastructure**: Leverages existing Node.js/Python agent infrastructure

  - **Configuration Management**: Uses framework's unified configuration system

  - **Memory Integration**: Leverages framework's mem0AI integration for intelligent testing

  - **CLI Integration**: Extends framework CLI with CMPM-QA specific commands


  ## Notes

  This epic represents the strategic shift from standalone CMPM-QA deployment to integrated framework component,
  aligning with the Claude PM Framework's unified architecture and eliminating the need for separate Docker containers
  or standalone services.
