## Epic Summary

Following the successful completion of EP-0043 (Code Maintainability - Reduce File Sizes), this epic addresses the critical need for comprehensive testing across all refactored modules. With 112+ new modules created and only 5% test coverage, establishing a robust testing framework is the highest priority for ensuring system reliability and maintainability.

## Background and Context

The EP-0043 refactoring created a well-structured, modular codebase with proper separation of concerns. However, the current test coverage of only 5% presents significant risks:
- No E2E tests for core agent functionality
- All refactored modules lack dedicated unit tests
- Critical path coverage is missing
- Integration tests for multi-module workflows are absent

## Objectives

1. **Achieve 80% test coverage** across the codebase (up from 5%)
2. **Establish comprehensive E2E testing** for all core agent functionality
3. **Create unit tests** for all 112+ refactored modules
4. **Implement integration tests** for multi-module workflows
5. **Ensure critical path coverage** for all user-facing functionality

## Scope

### E2E Testing Requirements

1. **Agent Discovery Testing**
   - Test agent discovery across all directories
   - Validate precedence rules (project → user → system)
   - Test dynamic agent loading and caching
   - Verify agent metadata extraction

2. **Agent Selection Testing**
   - Test optimal agent selection algorithms
   - Validate specialization-based routing
   - Test fallback mechanisms
   - Verify performance optimization

3. **Process Management Testing**
   - Test subprocess creation and management
   - Validate process lifecycle handling
   - Test error recovery mechanisms
   - Verify resource cleanup

4. **LOCAL Orchestration Testing**
   - Test local execution mode
   - Validate task delegation patterns
   - Test multi-agent coordination
   - Verify result integration

5. **Prompt Generation Testing**
   - Test prompt template processing
   - Validate variable substitution
   - Test context filtering
   - Verify prompt optimization

6. **Prompt Filtering Testing**
   - Test context-aware filtering
   - Validate security filtering
   - Test performance filtering
   - Verify content validation

### Unit Testing Requirements

Create comprehensive unit tests for all refactored modules:
- `agent_handlers.py` modules
- `local_executor.py` components
- `subprocess_executor.py` functions
- `orchestration_metrics.py` tracking
- `orchestration_types.py` validation
- All 112+ new modules from EP-0043

### Integration Testing Requirements

1. **Multi-Module Workflows**
   - Agent discovery → selection → execution
   - Task creation → delegation → result processing
   - Error handling across module boundaries
   - Performance optimization paths

2. **Service Integration**
   - Test service initialization sequences
   - Validate inter-service communication
   - Test configuration propagation
   - Verify state management

## Success Criteria

1. **Coverage Metrics**
   - Overall test coverage ≥ 80%
   - Critical path coverage = 100%
   - E2E test suite execution < 5 minutes
   - Unit test suite execution < 1 minute

2. **Quality Metrics**
   - All tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
   - No flaky tests
   - Clear test documentation
   - Maintainable test structure

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Test Infrastructure (Week 1)
- Set up test frameworks and utilities
- Create test fixtures and factories
- Establish coverage reporting
- Configure CI/CD integration

### Phase 2: E2E Test Suite (Weeks 2-3)
- Implement agent discovery tests
- Create agent selection tests
- Build process management tests
- Develop orchestration tests

### Phase 3: Unit Test Coverage (Weeks 3-4)
- Test all refactored modules
- Achieve module-level coverage targets
- Implement edge case testing
- Add performance benchmarks

### Phase 4: Integration Testing (Week 5)
- Create workflow integration tests
- Test service interactions
- Validate system boundaries
- Implement stress testing

### Phase 5: Documentation and Optimization (Week 6)
- Document test patterns
- Create testing guidelines
- Optimize test performance
- Establish maintenance procedures

## Technical Considerations

1. **Test Framework Selection**
   - pytest for Python testing
   - pytest-asyncio for async code
   - pytest-cov for coverage reporting
   - pytest-mock for mocking

2. **Test Organization**
   - Mirror source code structure
   - Separate E2E, integration, and unit tests
   - Use clear naming conventions
   - Implement test categorization

3. **Performance Requirements**
   - Fast test execution
   - Parallel test running
   - Efficient fixture usage
   - Minimal test dependencies

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Test Complexity**
   - Start with critical paths
   - Incremental coverage improvement
   - Regular review cycles
   - Pair programming for complex tests

2. **Maintenance Burden**
   - Clear test documentation
   - Reusable test utilities
   - Regular test refactoring
   - Automated test generation where possible

## Dependencies

- EP-0043 completion (DONE)
- Test framework setup
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Development team availability

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All E2E test scenarios implemented and passing
2. 80% overall test coverage achieved
3. 100% critical path coverage
4. All refactored modules have unit tests
5. Integration test suite operational
6. Test documentation complete
7. CI/CD pipeline integration working
8. Performance benchmarks established
