  # Epic: Claude PM Framework Optimization Initiative


  ## Overview

  Based on comprehensive semantic analysis using tree-sitter, this epic tracks the implementation of critical
  optimizations to improve the Claude PM Framework's efficiency, maintainability, and performance. The analysis revealed
  293 Python files with 90,349 lines of code requiring targeted improvements.


  ## Objectives

  - [ ] Improve type hint coverage from 71.4% to 90%+

  - [ ] Reduce unnecessary async function usage by 20%

  - [ ] Increase dataclass adoption from 30.7% to 60%+

  - [ ] Consolidate subprocess management from 57 scattered calls

  - [ ] Optimize import patterns and reduce circular dependencies

  - [ ] Implement caching layer for frequently accessed data

  - [ ] Adopt Python 3.11+ performance features where applicable


  ## Acceptance Criteria

  - [ ] Type hint coverage reaches 90%+ (measured by mypy)

  - [ ] Async functions reduced by 20% (from current 2,445 constructs)

  - [ ] Dataclass adoption reaches 60%+ of eligible classes

  - [ ] Subprocess calls consolidated into unified manager

  - [ ] All tests passing with no functionality regressions

  - [ ] Import time reduced by 30%

  - [ ] Memory usage reduced by 15%

  - [ ] Performance benchmarks show no degradation

  - Related Issue 1

  - Related Issue 2
