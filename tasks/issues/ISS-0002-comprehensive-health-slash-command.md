  # Issue: Implement Comprehensive Health Slash Command for All Subsystems


  ## Overview

  Create unified health monitoring command that provides complete system status across all framework components and
  managed projects.


  ## Current Status

  **80% Complete** - Design complete, implementation started, integration with ai-trackdown-tools pending.


  ## Implementation Scope


  ### Core Health Checks

  - [x] mem0AI service health (localhost:8002)

  - [x] Portfolio manager status

  - [x] Managed projects health overview

  - [ ] ai-trackdown-tools service status

  - [ ] Framework component availability

  - [ ] Integration endpoint validation


  ### Service Monitoring

  - [x] Service availability checks

  - [x] Response time monitoring  

  - [x] Error rate tracking

  - [ ] ai-trackdown-tools CLI functionality

  - [ ] Task system operational status

  - [ ] Memory system connectivity


  ### Reporting Features

  - [x] Consolidated health dashboard

  - [x] Service dependency mapping

  - [x] Performance metrics summary

  - [ ] ai-trackdown integration status

  - [ ] Migration progress tracking

  - [ ] System reliability scoring


  ## Acceptance Criteria


  ### Functionality

  - [ ] Single command provides complete system health overview

  - [ ] Integration with ai-trackdown-tools health monitoring

  - [ ] Clear status indicators for all major components

  - [ ] Performance metrics and response time reporting

  - [ ] Error detection and alerting capabilities


  ### Integration

  - [ ] Works with existing health monitoring infrastructure

  - [ ] Integrates with ai-trackdown-tools status reporting

  - [ ] Supports managed project health aggregation

  - [ ] Compatible with portfolio dashboard display


  ### User Experience

  - [ ] Clear, actionable health status output

  - [ ] Color-coded status indicators for quick assessment

  - [ ] Detailed drill-down capabilities for troubleshooting

  - [ ] Automated alerting for critical health issues


  ## Technical Requirements


  ### Dependencies

  - **ISS-0001**: ai-trackdown-tools cutover must be complete for full integration

  - **M01-006**: Health monitoring infrastructure (completed)

  - **M01-007**: Service management (completed)


  ### Implementation Notes

  - Design complete with 80% implementation progress

  - Waiting on ai-trackdown-tools integration for final 20%

  - Framework components ready for health monitoring integration


  ## Notes

  **Priority**: HIGH - Critical for system operational visibility

  **ETA**: Completion pending ISS-0001 (ai-trackdown-tools migration)

  **Impact**: Essential for maintaining system reliability and operational awareness
