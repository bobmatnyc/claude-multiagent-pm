  ## Memory Leak Analysis Report

  **Issue**: Node.js process consuming 8GB memory over ~6.5 minutes before crashing with heap out of memory error.

  ### Root Causes Identified:
  1. **Memory Configuration Issues:**
     - Node.js process configured with 8GB heap limit (--max-old-space-size=8192)
     - Process reaches limit and crashes with JavaScript heap out of memory

  2. **Cache Accumulation:**
     - Detection cache Map storing deployment configurations
     - Global objects (_claudePMCache, _deploymentCache, _memoryCache) growing unbounded
     - Cache cleanup every 30s insufficient for high-frequency operations

  3. **Subprocess Memory Leaks:**
     - activeSubprocesses Map tracking running processes
     - Memory history arrays growing without bounds in long-running sessions
     - Python subprocess spawning pattern accumulating memory in Node.js wrapper

  4. **Connection Management:**
     - Memory service connection pooling retaining closed connection references
     - Async operations in event loop not properly cleaned up

  ### Recommended Fixes:
  1. **Immediate**: Reduce heap limit to 4GB, increase GC frequency
  2. **Cache Management**: Reduce cleanup interval to 10s, implement LRU with stricter limits
  3. **Subprocess Lifecycle**: Implement 5-minute timeout with forced cleanup
  4. **Memory Circuit Breaker**: Exit process at 3.5GB threshold

  ### Priority: HIGH - Framework stability issue affecting long-running sessions

  **Error Stack**: JavaScript heap out of memory after 386615ms runtime
  **Framework Version**: 009
