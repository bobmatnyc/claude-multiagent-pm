# Issue: Modularize claude-pm script from monolithic 3,048-line file

## Description
Refactor bin/claude-pm from single 3,048-line monolithic file (115KB) into 7 logical modules for improved maintainability, testing, and memory efficiency. Analysis shows current memory allocation increased from 4GB to 8GB, making modularization critical for performance optimization.

## Current Analysis
- **File Size**: 3,048 lines, 115KB
- **Location**: bin/claude-pm
- **Memory Impact**: Framework recently required 4GBâ†’8GB allocation increase
- **Technical Debt**: Single file handling multiple responsibilities

## Proposed Module Structure (7 Modules)

### 1. Deployment Detector Module (536 lines)
- **Responsibility**: Detect deployment environments (Development, Parent Directory)
- **Lines**: ~536 (largest module)
- **Priority**: High (core functionality)

### 2. Framework Manager Module (540 lines)
- **Responsibility**: Initialize and manage framework components
- **Lines**: ~540 (second largest)
- **Priority**: High (core functionality)

### 3. Command Dispatcher Module (400 lines)
- **Responsibility**: Parse and route commands to appropriate handlers
- **Lines**: ~400
- **Priority**: Medium (routing logic)

### 4. Template System Module (300 lines)
- **Responsibility**: Handle template deployment and management
- **Lines**: ~300
- **Priority**: Medium (template operations)

### 5. Configuration Manager Module (250 lines)
- **Responsibility**: Load and validate configuration settings
- **Lines**: ~250
- **Priority**: Medium (configuration handling)

### 6. Error Handler Module (200 lines)
- **Responsibility**: Centralized error handling and user feedback
- **Lines**: ~200
- **Priority**: Low (support functionality)

### 7. Utilities Module (322 lines)
- **Responsibility**: Shared utility functions and helpers
- **Lines**: ~322 (remaining)
- **Priority**: Low (support functionality)

## Implementation Timeline (8 Weeks)

### Phase 1: Core Module Extraction (Weeks 1-3)
- [ ] Extract Deployment Detector Module (536 lines)
- [ ] Extract Framework Manager Module (540 lines)
- [ ] Implement module interface contracts
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for extracted modules

### Phase 2: Secondary Module Development (Weeks 4-6)
- [ ] Extract Command Dispatcher Module (400 lines)
- [ ] Extract Template System Module (300 lines)
- [ ] Extract Configuration Manager Module (250 lines)
- [ ] Implement cross-module communication protocols

### Phase 3: Finalization and Optimization (Weeks 7-8)
- [ ] Extract Error Handler Module (200 lines)
- [ ] Extract Utilities Module (322 lines)
- [ ] Performance optimization and memory profiling
- [ ] Integration testing with full framework

## Tasks

### Phase 1 Tasks
- [ ] Create module directory structure under bin/modules/
- [ ] Extract deployment-detector.js (536 lines)
- [ ] Extract framework-manager.js (540 lines)
- [ ] Create module interface specifications
- [ ] Write unit tests for core modules
- [ ] Validate core functionality with extracted modules

### Phase 2 Tasks
- [ ] Extract command-dispatcher.js (400 lines)
- [ ] Extract template-system.js (300 lines)
- [ ] Extract configuration-manager.js (250 lines)
- [ ] Implement module dependency injection
- [ ] Create integration test suite
- [ ] Performance benchmarking against monolithic version

### Phase 3 Tasks
- [ ] Extract error-handler.js (200 lines)
- [ ] Extract utilities.js (322 lines)
- [ ] Memory optimization analysis
- [ ] Full system integration testing
- [ ] Documentation update for new architecture
- [ ] Deployment verification across all environments

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All existing claude-pm functionality preserved
- [ ] No breaking changes to CLI interface
- [ ] All commands work identically to monolithic version
- [ ] Memory usage reduced by minimum 15%
- [ ] Startup time improved or maintained

### Code Quality Requirements
- [ ] Each module under 600 lines maximum
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage for all modules
- [ ] Clear module boundaries and interfaces
- [ ] No circular dependencies between modules
- [ ] JSDoc documentation for all public functions

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Memory allocation requirement reduced below 6GB
- [ ] CLI response time maintained or improved
- [ ] Module loading overhead under 50ms
- [ ] Test suite execution time under 2 minutes

### Maintainability Requirements
- [ ] Each module has single responsibility
- [ ] Clear separation of concerns
- [ ] Standardized error handling across modules
- [ ] Consistent coding patterns and naming conventions

## Benefits

### Immediate Benefits
- **Reduced Memory Pressure**: Target 25% reduction in memory usage
- **Improved Testability**: Individual module testing
- **Better Code Organization**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Easier Debugging**: Isolated functionality for faster troubleshooting

### Long-term Benefits
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Smaller, focused modules
- **Faster Development**: Parallel development on different modules
- **Improved Onboarding**: New developers can understand individual modules
- **Future Extensibility**: Easier to add new features without affecting core logic

## Risk Mitigation
- **Backup Strategy**: Complete backup of current bin/claude-pm before changes
- **Incremental Approach**: Phase-based implementation reduces risk
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive test coverage before deployment
- **Rollback Plan**: Maintain monolithic version as fallback during transition

## Success Metrics
- Memory usage reduced from 8GB to <6GB requirement
- Module count: 7 modules, each <600 lines
- Test coverage: >90% for all modules
- Performance: No regression in CLI response times
- Code quality: Improved maintainability score via static analysis

## Notes
This refactoring addresses critical technical debt accumulated in the monolithic claude-pm script. The recent memory allocation increase from 4GB to 8GB indicates the urgent need for optimization. The proposed modular architecture will enable better resource management, improved testing capabilities, and enhanced long-term maintainability of the core framework component.
