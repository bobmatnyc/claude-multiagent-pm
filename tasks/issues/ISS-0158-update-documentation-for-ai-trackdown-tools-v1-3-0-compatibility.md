title: Update documentation for ai-trackdown-tools v1.3.0 compatibility
description: >-
  ## Summary

  Update ai-trackdown documentation to reflect the enhancements made in ai-trackdown-tools v1.3.0.


  ## Changes to Document


  ### Parser Enhancements

  - Fixed the `this.frontmatterParser.parse is not a function` bug in github-sync

  - Added support for three issue file formats:
    1. Standard YAML frontmatter with content after ---
    2. Legacy format where content is in a YAML `content:` field
    3. Files with no frontmatter at all

  ### Automatic Compliance Fixing

  - New TicketComplianceFixer class automatically fixes non-compliant tickets during indexing

  - Fixes ticket ID formats (pads to 4 digits: ISS-1 → ISS-0001)

  - Ensures filenames follow correct naming convention with slugified titles

  - Adds missing required frontmatter fields

  - Integrated into TrackdownIndexManager for automatic fixing


  ### Schema Updates

  - Documented that Epic IDs use EP-XXXX format (not EPIC-XXXX)

  - Added comprehensive Relationship Management section explaining:
    - Parent-child relationships stored in frontmatter only
    - No duplication of parent IDs in ticket body
    - Comment organization and naming conventions

  ### Compatibility

  - ai-trackdown-tools v1.3.0 is compatible with ai-trackdown v1.0.0+

  - Added `aiTrackdownCompatibility` field to package.json


  ## Technical Details

  The parser now handles all legacy formats gracefully and the indexer automatically fixes compliance issues, making the
  system more robust and user-friendly.
