description: >-
  ## Overview

  Implement intelligent documentation system with context-aware help, guided setup, and interactive onboarding
  capabilities.


  ## Key Features Required:

  - ✅ Context-aware help system based on current command and flags

  - ✅ Interactive setup wizards for guided installation

  - ✅ Command suggestion engine with intelligent recommendations

  - ✅ Error explanation system with actionable solutions

  - ✅ Usage pattern analysis and optimization suggestions

  - ✅ Progressive disclosure for feature discovery


  ## Documentation Features:

  **InteractiveDocumentationManager Components:**

  - DocumentationGenerator for dynamic content creation

  - ContextAnalyzer for situation-aware help

  - IntelligentHelpSystem for smart suggestions

  - SetupWizard for guided configuration


  **User Onboarding Workflow:**

  1. Environment Assessment (analyze existing setup)

  2. Guided Installation (step-by-step with validation)

  3. Configuration Customization (project-specific setup)

  4. Agent Introduction (interactive capability demonstration)

  5. Workflow Walkthrough (guided tour of common workflows)

  6. Validation & Testing (comprehensive setup validation)


  ## Implementation Components:

  - generate_contextual_help() method

  - provide_guided_setup() with UserContext

  - suggest_next_actions() based on FrameworkState

  - Progressive disclosure system


  ## Success Criteria:

  - Setup completion rate >90%

  - User onboarding satisfaction >4.5/5

  - Feature discovery rate >70% for core features
