# Issue: QA Agent Browser Testing Integration

## Description
Enhance existing QA agent with framework-integrated browser extension capabilities, leveraging agent hierarchy for test coordination and framework's mem0AI for intelligent test pattern recognition.

## Framework Integration Components
- **Agent Hierarchy Integration**: Leverages existing MultiAgentOrchestrator for QA agent coordination
- **Memory-Augmented Testing**: Uses framework's mem0AI for intelligent test pattern recognition
- **Configuration Management**: Integrated with framework's unified configuration system
- **Health Monitoring**: Leverages framework health checks and CLI status reporting

## Implementation Tasks
- [x] **Agent Enhancement**: Enhanced QA agent with framework-integrated browser capabilities
- [x] **Test Coordination**: Leverages existing agent hierarchy for test plan execution
- [x] **Memory Integration**: Uses framework's mem0AI for intelligent test pattern recognition
- [x] **Health Monitoring**: Integrated with framework health checks and CLI status

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] **Framework Integration**: QA agent enhanced with framework-integrated browser extension capabilities
- [x] **Agent Hierarchy**: Leverages existing MultiAgentOrchestrator for test coordination
- [x] **Memory Integration**: Uses framework's mem0AI for intelligent test pattern recognition
- [x] **Configuration Management**: Integrated with framework's unified configuration system
- [x] **Health Monitoring**: Leverages framework health checks and CLI status reporting

## Framework Integration Benefits
- **Agent Coordination**: Leverages existing agent hierarchy for seamless test coordination
- **Memory Intelligence**: Uses framework's mem0AI for intelligent test pattern recognition
- **Configuration Management**: Integrated with framework's unified configuration system
- **Health Monitoring**: Leverages framework health checks and CLI status reporting
- **CLI Integration**: Extends framework CLI with QA-specific commands

## Notes
This issue was completed with focus on framework integration, ensuring the QA agent enhancement leverages the Claude PM Framework's existing infrastructure rather than requiring standalone services or separate deployments.
