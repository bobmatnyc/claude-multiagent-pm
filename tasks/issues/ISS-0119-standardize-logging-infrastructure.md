title: Standardize Logging Infrastructure
description: >-
  ## Overview

  Standardize the logging infrastructure across the codebase by consolidating
  71 duplicate logging patterns into a unified, configurable logging system
  with consistent formatting, level management, and output handling.

  ## Problem Statement:

  The current codebase contains 71 duplicate logging patterns across multiple files:
  - Inconsistent logging configuration and initialization
  - Multiple logger creation patterns and naming conventions
  - Duplicated formatting and output handling logic
  - Inconsistent log level management across modules
  - Scattered configuration and no centralized control

  ## Unified Logging Architecture:

  **Core Logging Framework:**
  - `core/logging/unified_logger.py` - Central logger factory and configuration
  - `core/logging/formatters.py` - Standardized log formatters and output styles
  - `core/logging/handlers.py` - Configurable output handlers (file, console, remote)
  - `core/logging/filters.py` - Log filtering and level management

  **Configuration Management:**
  - `core/logging/config/logging_config.py` - Centralized logging configuration
  - `core/logging/config/environment_adapter.py` - Environment-specific adaptations
  - `core/logging/config/dynamic_config.py` - Runtime configuration updates

  **Specialized Loggers:**
  - `core/logging/specialized/performance_logger.py` - Performance and timing logs
  - `core/logging/specialized/security_logger.py` - Security event logging
  - `core/logging/specialized/audit_logger.py` - Audit trail and compliance logs
  - `core/logging/specialized/debug_logger.py` - Development and debugging logs

  ## Implementation Plan:

  **Phase 1: Core Framework (Days 1-2)**
  1. Create unified logger factory and configuration system
  2. Implement standardized formatters and handlers
  3. Create centralized configuration management
  4. Implement log filtering and level management

  **Phase 2: Pattern Consolidation (Days 2-3)**
  1. Identify and catalog all 71 logging patterns
  2. Create migration mapping from old to new patterns
  3. Implement automated migration tools
  4. Update core modules to use unified logging

  **Phase 3: Specialized Loggers (Day 3)**
  1. Create performance logging specialization
  2. Implement security event logging
  3. Create audit trail logging
  4. Implement development debugging tools

  **Phase 4: Migration and Validation (Days 3-4)**
  1. Migrate remaining modules to unified logging
  2. Validate log output consistency
  3. Performance testing and optimization
  4. Documentation and usage guidelines

  ## Success Criteria:

  - Reduce logging patterns from 71 duplicates to 1 unified system
  - All modules use standardized logging interfaces
  - Centralized configuration enables runtime adjustments
  - Log format consistency across all components
  - Performance overhead reduced by 15%+
  - Debugging and troubleshooting improved significantly

  ## Dependencies:

  - Must maintain compatibility with existing log analysis tools
  - Log level semantics must be preserved
  - All existing log output must remain functional during migration
  - Performance impact must be minimal or positive

  ## Testing Requirements:

  - Unit tests for unified logging framework
  - Integration tests for log output consistency
  - Performance testing for logging overhead
  - Migration validation tests
  - Log analysis tool compatibility testing

  ## Reference:

  Based on codebase analysis identifying 71 duplicate logging patterns
  as a significant maintainability and consistency issue.

# Issue: Standardize Logging Infrastructure

## Description
Standardize the logging infrastructure across the codebase by consolidating 71 duplicate logging patterns into a unified, configurable logging system with consistent formatting, level management, and output handling.

The current codebase contains 71 duplicate logging patterns across multiple files:
- Inconsistent logging configuration and initialization
- Multiple logger creation patterns and naming conventions
- Duplicated formatting and output handling logic
- Inconsistent log level management across modules
- Scattered configuration and no centralized control

- `core/logging/unified_logger.py` - Central logger factory and configuration
- `core/logging/formatters.py` - Standardized log formatters and output styles
- `core/logging/handlers.py` - Configurable output handlers (file, console, remote)
- `core/logging/filters.py` - Log filtering and level management

**Configuration Management:**
- `core/logging/config/logging_config.py` - Centralized logging configuration
- `core/logging/config/environment_adapter.py` - Environment-specific adaptations
- `core/logging/config/dynamic_config.py` - Runtime configuration updates

**Specialized Loggers:**
- `core/logging/specialized/performance_logger.py` - Performance and timing logs
- `core/logging/specialized/security_logger.py` - Security event logging
