title: Modularize System Init Agent Components
description: >-
  ## Overview

  Refactor the System Init Agent (claude_pm/agents/system_init_agent.py - 2,275 lines)
  into specialized components for initialization workflows, dependency management,
  platform detection, and system validation.

  ## Problem Statement:

  The current System Init Agent has grown to 2,275 lines, handling:
  - System initialization and setup workflows (500+ lines)
  - Dependency validation and installation (400+ lines)
  - Platform detection and configuration (350+ lines)
  - Directory structure creation (300+ lines)
  - Configuration file management (250+ lines)
  - Health checking and validation (225+ lines)
  - Error handling and recovery (250+ lines)

  ## Component Architecture:

  **Core Initialization Layer:**
  - `agents/init/workflow_orchestrator.py` - Main initialization workflow coordination
  - `agents/init/dependency_manager.py` - Dependency validation and installation
  - `agents/init/platform_detector.py` - Platform-specific detection and configuration
  - `agents/init/structure_builder.py` - Directory and file structure creation

  **Configuration Layer:**
  - `agents/init/config/config_manager.py` - Configuration file management
  - `agents/init/config/template_processor.py` - Template processing and deployment
  - `agents/init/config/variable_resolver.py` - Variable resolution and substitution

  **Validation Layer:**
  - `agents/init/validation/health_checker.py` - System health validation
  - `agents/init/validation/prerequisite_validator.py` - Prerequisite checking
  - `agents/init/validation/integrity_verifier.py` - Installation integrity verification

  **Platform-Specific Modules:**
  - `agents/init/platforms/macos_handler.py` - macOS-specific initialization
  - `agents/init/platforms/linux_handler.py` - Linux-specific initialization
  - `agents/init/platforms/windows_handler.py` - Windows-specific initialization

  ## Implementation Plan:

  **Phase 1: Core Extraction (Days 1-2)**
  1. Extract workflow orchestration logic
  2. Separate dependency management functionality
  3. Create platform detection service
  4. Modularize structure building components

  **Phase 2: Configuration Modularization (Days 2-3)**
  1. Extract configuration management logic
  2. Separate template processing functionality
  3. Create variable resolution service

  **Phase 3: Validation Components (Days 3-4)**
  1. Extract health checking functionality
  2. Create prerequisite validation service
  3. Implement integrity verification system

  **Phase 4: Platform Specialization (Days 4-5)**
  1. Create platform-specific handlers
  2. Implement platform abstraction layer
  3. Integration testing and validation

  ## Success Criteria:

  - System Init Agent reduced from 2,275 lines to <300 lines (orchestrator)
  - Each component module <250 lines
  - Platform-specific logic properly separated
  - All initialization workflows preserved
  - Dependency management improved and testable
  - Setup time reduced by 15%+

  ## Dependencies:

  - Must maintain compatibility with CMCP-init integration
  - All platform detection logic must be preserved
  - Dependency installation workflows must remain functional
  - Health checking capabilities must be maintained

  ## Testing Requirements:

  - Unit tests for each component module
  - Platform-specific testing on macOS, Linux, Windows
  - Integration tests for complete initialization workflows
  - Dependency installation validation tests
  - Health check and validation testing

  ## Reference:

  Based on codebase analysis identifying System Init Agent as third highest
  complexity target with critical system setup responsibilities.

## Tasks
- [ ] Extract workflow orchestration logic into dedicated component
- [ ] Separate dependency management functionality
- [ ] Create platform detection service with abstraction layer
- [ ] Modularize directory and file structure building

- [ ] System Init Agent reduced to <300 lines (orchestrator only)
- [ ] Each component module is <250 lines
- [ ] Platform-specific logic properly separated and testable
- [ ] All initialization workflows preserved and functional
- [ ] Dependency management improved with better error handling

- [ ] Unit test coverage >85% for all components
- [ ] Integration tests validate complete workflows
- [ ] Platform-specific testing passes on all target platforms

## Notes
This agent is critical for system initialization and setup workflows. The modularization must preserve all existing functionality while improving testability and platform-specific handling. Special attention needed for CMCP-init integration compatibility.
