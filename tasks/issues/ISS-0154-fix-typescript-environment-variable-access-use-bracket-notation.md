title: Fix TypeScript environment variable access - use bracket notation
description: Need to fix all TypeScript TS4111 errors requiring bracket notation for index signatures. Originally 224
  errors - 219 were environment variable access (now fixed), and 126 remain for object property access. These errors
  prevent TypeScript compilation and pnpm run type-check from passing. Errors are spread across src/app, src/components,
  src/lib, and src/test directories.

  # Issue: Fix TypeScript environment variable access - use bracket notation


  ## Description

  Need to fix 224 TypeScript errors where environment variables are accessed using dot notation (e.g.,
  process.env.VAR_NAME) instead of the required bracket notation (e.g., process.env["VAR_NAME"]). This is blocking
  TypeScript compilation and preventing pnpm run type-check from passing. Errors are spread across src/app,
  src/components, src/lib, and src/test directories.


  ## Tasks

  - [ ] Task 1

  - [ ] Task 2

  - [ ] Task 3


  ## Acceptance Criteria

  - [ ] Criteria 1

  - [ ] Criteria 2
