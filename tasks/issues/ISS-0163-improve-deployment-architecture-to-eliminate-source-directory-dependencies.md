  # Issue: Improve deployment architecture to eliminate source directory dependencies


  ## Problem Statement


  The current deployment architecture has several critical issues that make installation and deployment brittle:


  1. **Source Directory Dependencies**: Deployed scripts (claude-pm, cmpm) execute from source directory rather than
  proper installed packages

  2. **Complex Path Detection**: Scripts contain convoluted logic to find the source directory, making deployment
  fragile

  3. **Version Synchronization Issues**: Multiple version files (VERSION, package.json, pyproject.toml, _version.py)
  must be manually kept in sync

  4. **Mixed Installation Models**: NPM package installs but doesn't properly distribute Python code, leading to
  cross-platform issues

  5. **No Wheel Distribution**: Despite having pyproject.toml, the framework doesn't build distributable Python wheels

  6. **Installation Conflicts**: Mixed npm/pip installation creates dependency conflicts and confusion


  ## Current Pain Points


  - Users can't easily install via standard Python tools (pip)

  - NPM installation requires source directory to remain intact

  - Version updates require manual synchronization across 4+ files

  - Cross-platform compatibility issues (Windows path detection fails)

  - No clean uninstall/upgrade path

  - Source directory modifications affect all installations


  ## Proposed Solution


  ### Phase 1: Build Python Wheels (Maintain Compatibility)

  - Configure pyproject.toml for proper wheel building

  - Create distributable .whl files with all dependencies

  - Maintain current npm installation for backward compatibility

  - Test wheel installation alongside existing approach


  ### Phase 2: Publish to PyPI

  - Register package on PyPI as `claude-multiagent-pm`

  - Enable `pip install claude-multiagent-pm`

  - Maintain npm package as installer that delegates to pip

  - Provide clear migration path for existing users


  ### Phase 3: Simplify NPM Package

  - Convert npm package to installer-only role

  - Have npm postinstall run `pip install claude-multiagent-pm`

  - Remove Python source from npm distribution

  - Maintain CLI entry points for compatibility


  ### Phase 4: Deprecate Source Execution

  - Remove source directory path detection from scripts

  - Scripts execute from proper site-packages location

  - Clean separation between development and production

  - Automated version synchronization from single source


  ## Implementation Plan


  ### 1. Python Packaging Infrastructure

  - [ ] Update pyproject.toml with proper build configuration

  - [ ] Add setuptools_scm for automatic version management

  - [ ] Configure entry_points for CLI commands

  - [ ] Create MANIFEST.in for non-Python files

  - [ ] Test wheel building with `python -m build`


  ### 2. Version Management Consolidation

  - [ ] Make pyproject.toml the single source of truth

  - [ ] Auto-generate VERSION file during build

  - [ ] Sync package.json version from Python package

  - [ ] Remove manual version management code

  - [ ] Add version validation to CI/CD


  ### 3. Build and Distribution Pipeline

  - [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for wheel building

  - [ ] Configure PyPI publishing workflow

  - [ ] Add wheel testing in CI pipeline

  - [ ] Create release automation

  - [ ] Document release process


  ### 4. NPM Package Refactoring

  - [ ] Remove Python source from npm package

  - [ ] Update postinstall to use pip

  - [ ] Add pip availability checking

  - [ ] Provide fallback for systems without pip

  - [ ] Update npm package documentation


  ### 5. Migration and Compatibility

  - [ ] Create migration guide for existing users

  - [ ] Provide automated migration script

  - [ ] Maintain backward compatibility flags

  - [ ] Add deprecation warnings for source execution

  - [ ] Document breaking changes


  ## Success Criteria


  - [ ] No source directory dependencies in deployed code

  - [ ] Single command installation: `pip install claude-multiagent-pm` OR `npm install -g
  @bobmatnyc/claude-multiagent-pm`

  - [ ] Automatic version synchronization from single source

  - [ ] Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

  - [ ] Clean uninstall/upgrade process

  - [ ] No manual version management required

  - [ ] Proper Python packaging best practices

  - [ ] PyPI publication with regular releases

  - [ ] Clear separation of development and production environments


  ## Technical Details


  ### Current Architecture Issues

  ```

  # Current problematic pattern in claude-pm script:

  script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))

  parent_dir = os.path.dirname(script_dir)

  sys.path.insert(0, parent_dir)  # PROBLEM: Assumes source layout

  ```


  ### Proposed Architecture

  ```

  # Proper installed package pattern:

  from claude_pm.cli import main  # Imports from site-packages

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      main()
  ```


  ### Version Management Strategy

  ```toml

  # pyproject.toml becomes single source:

  [tool.setuptools_scm]

  write_to = "claude_pm/_version.py"

  version_scheme = "post-release"

  ```


  ## Related Issues

  - Version synchronization problems

  - Cross-platform installation failures

  - NPM postinstall script errors

  - Source directory permission issues


  ## Notes

  - This is a high-priority architectural improvement that will significantly improve user experience

  - Must maintain backward compatibility during transition

  - Consider creating `claude-pm-legacy` package for users who need source execution

  - Coordinate with npm registry and PyPI for namespace availability

   - Now correctly detects version from installed package metadata
   - Falls back gracefully when package not installed (development mode)

2. **Path Resolution Updates**:
   - Removed hardcoded source directory assumptions
   - Updated `framework/CLAUDE.md` path resolution to use package resources
   - Fixed script paths to work from site-packages installation

3. **Deployment Script Improvements**:
   - Updated `claude-pm` and `cmpm` scripts for wheel compatibility
   - Removed complex source directory detection logic
   - Scripts now properly import from installed package location

4. **Testing Results**:
   - Built wheel: 943KB containing 359 files
   - Tested installation: `pip install dist/claude_multiagent_pm-1.2.4-py3-none-any.whl`
   - Verified `claude-pm init` works without source directory
   - Confirmed framework template deployment functions correctly

## Technical Details

### Current Architecture Issues
```
# Current problematic pattern in claude-pm script:
script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
parent_dir = os.path.dirname(script_dir)
sys.path.insert(0, parent_dir)  # PROBLEM: Assumes source layout
```

### Proposed Architecture
```
# Proper installed package pattern:
from claude_pm.cli import main  # Imports from site-packages
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Version Management Strategy
```toml
# pyproject.toml becomes single source:
[tool.setuptools_scm]
write_to = "claude_pm/_version.py"
version_scheme = "post-release"
```
