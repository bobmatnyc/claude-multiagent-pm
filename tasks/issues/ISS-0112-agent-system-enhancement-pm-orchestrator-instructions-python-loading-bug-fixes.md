  # Agent System Enhancement: PM Orchestrator Instructions & Python Loading Bug Fixes

  ## Priority: HIGH
  **Created**: 2025-07-14  
  **Target Sprint**: Current (Q3 2025)  
  **Estimated Effort**: 8-12 hours  

  ## Problem Statement
  Critical issues have been identified in the agent system that are blocking proper framework operation:

  ### 1. Critical Python Agent Loading Bug
  - **Issue**: Relative import failures when loading Python agents
  - **Impact**: Agent subprocess creation fails, breaking Task Tool delegation
  - **Error Pattern**: ModuleNotFoundError and import resolution failures
  - **Affected Components**: All Python-based agents in subprocess execution

  ### 2. Missing PM Orchestrator Instruction File
  - **Issue**: PM agent lacks dedicated instruction file for orchestrator role
  - **Impact**: Inconsistent PM behavior and unclear delegation patterns
  - **Required**: Comprehensive PM orchestrator instruction template
  - **Integration**: Must align with existing CLAUDE.md deployment instructions

  ### 3. System Init Agent Consolidation
  - **Issue**: System init agent should be consolidated into PM agent responsibilities
  - **Rationale**: PM is the primary orchestrator and should handle initialization
  - **Impact**: Simplified agent hierarchy and clearer responsibility boundaries
  - **Architecture**: Three-tier system (Project → User → System) with PM as primary

  ### 4. Agent Instruction Format Standardization
  - **Issue**: Inconsistent instruction formats across different agent types
  - **Impact**: Unclear agent capabilities and inconsistent behavior
  - **Required**: Standardized instruction template format
  - **Coverage**: All agent types need consistent instruction structure

  ### 5. Memory Collection Integration Enhancement
  - **Issue**: Memory collection integration needs enhancement across all agent types
  - **Impact**: Inconsistent bug tracking and feedback collection
  - **Required**: Standardized memory collection patterns for all agents
  - **Compliance**: Must meet mandatory memory collection requirements

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  ### 1. Python Agent Loading Fix
