  # Issue: CMPM-QA Chrome Extension Development


  ## Description

  Develop Chrome/Edge compatible browser extension with Manifest v3 for framework-native deployment. Integrates with
  Claude PM Framework agent hierarchy through unified configuration and health monitoring, eliminating standalone
  service requirements.


  ## Framework Integration Requirements

  - **Framework-Native Deployment**: Deploy as integrated component within Claude PM Framework

  - **Agent Hierarchy Integration**: Communicate directly with MultiAgentOrchestrator

  - **Unified Configuration**: Use framework configuration management system

  - **Health Monitoring**: Integrate with framework health checks and CLI status


  ## Implementation Tasks

  - [ ] **Extension Core**: Manifest v3 browser extension with framework integration

  - [ ] **Agent Communication**: Direct integration with Claude PM Framework agent system

  - [ ] **Configuration Management**: Framework configuration system integration

  - [ ] **Health Monitoring**: Framework health check and CLI status integration

  - [ ] **Testing Integration**: Memory-augmented test pattern recognition using framework's mem0AI


  ## Acceptance Criteria

  - [ ] **Framework Integration**: Extension deployed as integrated framework component

  - [ ] **Agent Communication**: Direct communication with MultiAgentOrchestrator

  - [ ] **Configuration Management**: Uses framework's unified configuration system

  - [ ] **Health Monitoring**: Integrated with framework health checks and CLI commands

  - [ ] **No Standalone Services**: Eliminates need for separate local service bridge


  ## Technology Stack Alignment

  - **Framework Infrastructure**: Leverages existing Node.js/Python agent infrastructure

  - **Configuration**: Uses framework's unified configuration system

  - **Memory Integration**: Leverages framework's mem0AI integration

  - **CLI Integration**: Extends framework CLI with extension-specific commands


  ## Notes

  This issue represents the shift from standalone extension with separate service to framework-integrated extension that
  communicates directly with the Claude PM Framework agent hierarchy, eliminating the need for separate Docker
  containers or standalone services.
