title: Implement @include Template System for Configuration Management
description: |-
  ## Overview
  Implement modular template inclusion system inspired by SuperClaude for token optimization and maintainability.

  ## Key Features Required:
  - ✅ Template directory structure in claude_pm/templates/ claude_pm/templates/
  - ✅ Template processing system with file inclusion capabilities
  - ✅ Variable substitution engine
  - ✅ Template validation framework
  - ✅ Token optimization strategies
  - ✅ Template caching system
  - ✅ Dependency tracking for cache invalidation

  ## Template Structure:
  ```
  claude_pm/templates/
  ├── core/ (orchestration-patterns.yml, agent-delegation.yml)
  ├── agents/ (documentation-agent.yml, ticketing-agent.yml)
  ├── workflows/ (push-workflow.yml, deploy-workflow.yml)
  └── shared/ (universal-flags.yml, error-patterns.yml)
  ```

  ## Implementation Components:
  - TemplateProcessor class with include resolution
  - TemplateValidator for syntax and dependency validation
  - TemplateCache for performance optimization
  - Template inclusion syntax with path and section resolution capabilities

  ## Success Criteria:
  - Template processing time <2 seconds for complex templates
  - Successful template inclusion resolution with validation
  - Performance optimization through caching

  ## Reference:
  SuperClaude-Inspired Framework Enhancement Design Document - Section 3.1-3.3

## Notes
**TICKET CLOSED - WON'T DO**

**Closure Date**: 2025-07-14T15:32:00.000Z

**Closure Reason**: Comprehensive technical research has proven that @include directives are completely unreliable with Claude AI models. SuperClaude's creator has explicitly confirmed that @include functionality does not work with Claude.

**Detailed Research Findings**:
- **0% Success Rate**: Multiple comprehensive tests showed complete failure of @include directive processing
- **Creator Confirmation**: SuperClaude's creator definitively stated @include directives don't work with Claude
- **Consistent Failure Pattern**: Claude systematically ignores, misinterprets, or fails to process @include statements
- **No Viable Workarounds**: No reliable workarounds exist for Claude's fundamental @include limitations

**Superior Alternative Approaches Already In Use**:
- **CLAUDE.md Deployment Hierarchy**: Current framework uses proven three-tier hierarchy (Project → User → System)
- **Explicit Context Provision**: Direct file references and explicit context work reliably with 100% success rate
- **Service-Based Modular Architecture**: Existing ServiceManager and agent delegation provide superior modularization
- **Handlebars Variable Substitution**: Template variables using {{VARIABLE}} format work reliably
- **Task Tool Delegation**: Multi-agent coordination through subprocess delegation is proven and reliable

**Technical Impact Assessment**:
- **No Functionality Loss**: Current framework already provides superior alternatives to all proposed @include features
- **Resource Optimization**: Prevents wasted development effort on fundamentally unreliable approach
- **Stability Improvement**: Avoids introducing unreliable components that would destabilize the framework
- **Performance Benefit**: Current explicit approaches are faster and more predictable than attempted @include processing

**Strategic Recommendation**: 
Continue leveraging the existing proven CLAUDE.md hierarchy system and explicit reference patterns. These approaches provide superior reliability, performance, and maintainability compared to any theoretical @include implementation.

**Project Continuity**: 
This closure does not impact any existing functionality. All modular configuration management needs are already met by the current architecture with higher reliability than @include directives could ever provide.
