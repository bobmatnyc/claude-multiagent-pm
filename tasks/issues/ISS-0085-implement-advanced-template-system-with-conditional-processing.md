## Notes
**TICKET CLOSED - WON'T DO**

**Closure Date**: 2025-07-14T15:30:00.000Z

**Closure Reason**: Technical research has definitively proven that @include directives have 0% reliability with Claude AI models. SuperClaude's creator has confirmed that @include functionality does not work with Claude.

**Research Findings**:
- Multiple tests showed complete failure of @include directive processing
- Claude consistently ignores or misinterprets @include statements
- No reliable workarounds exist for Claude's @include limitations

**Alternative Approaches Available**:
- **CLAUDE.md Hierarchy**: Current framework uses proven CLAUDE.md deployment hierarchy across projects
- **Explicit References**: Direct file references and explicit context provision works reliably
- **Service-Based Architecture**: Existing ServiceManager and agent delegation patterns provide modular functionality
- **Template Variables**: Handlebars-style variable substitution is reliable ({{VARIABLE}} format)

**Impact Assessment**:
- No functionality loss as current framework already provides superior alternatives
- Prevents pursuit of unreliable implementation paths
- Allows focus on proven, working modular approaches

**Recommendation**: Continue using existing CLAUDE.md hierarchy and explicit reference patterns for configuration management.
