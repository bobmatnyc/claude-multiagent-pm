title: Implement Robust Installer Architecture with Platform Detection
description: >-
  ## Overview

  Implement comprehensive installer architecture inspired by SuperClaude patterns with enhanced reliability and
  cross-platform support.


  ## Key Features Required:

  - ✅ Platform detection (macOS, Linux, WSL)

  - ✅ Dependency validation and checking

  - ✅ Disk space requirements validation

  - ✅ Backup creation with timestamping

  - ✅ Dry-run capabilities for preview

  - ✅ Update mode with customization preservation

  - ✅ Rollback functionality

  - ✅ Progress tracking with detailed logging


  ## Implementation Details:

  - Create  with comprehensive error handling

  - Support installation modes: standard, update, dry-run, force, rollback, verify

  - Implement backup management system in 

  - Add retention policy: 5 most recent backups with automatic cleanup

  - Include integrity validation of backup contents


  ## Success Criteria:

  - Installation success rate >95%

  - Cross-platform compatibility verified

  - Backup/restore functionality tested and validated


  ## Reference:

  SuperClaude-Inspired Framework Enhancement Design Document - Section 2.1-2.3
