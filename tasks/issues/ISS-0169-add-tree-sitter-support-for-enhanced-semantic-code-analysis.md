title: Add Tree-sitter support for enhanced semantic code analysis
description: >-
  Implement Tree-sitter parsing to replace/enhance current Python AST parsing in MetadataAnalyzer. Tree-sitter provides
  40+ language support, 36x performance improvement, incremental parsing, and error-tolerant parsing. This will enable
  semantic code analysis across multiple languages including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Markdown, and configuration
  files.


  Key implementation requirements:

  1. Add tree-sitter-languages to both npm (package.json) and PyPI (pyproject.toml) dependencies

  2. Create TreeSitterAnalyzer class alongside MetadataAnalyzer for backward compatibility

  3. Update Research Agent instructions to use Tree-sitter AST analysis as primary method for codebase analysis tasks

  4. Support incremental parsing for real-time modification tracking

  5. Implement language-specific query patterns for agent discovery


  Benefits:

  - 36x performance improvement over current AST parsing

  - Support for 40+ programming languages (vs Python-only currently)

  - Error-tolerant parsing (works with invalid/incomplete code)

  - Incremental parsing for real-time updates

  - Semantic understanding of Markdown and config files
