# ISS-0124: Implement Asynchronous Memory Collection System

## Overview
**Title**: Implement Asynchronous Memory Collection System for Enhanced Performance  
**Type**: Enhancement  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: Open  
**Created**: 2025-07-15  
**Assigned**: Engineer Agent  

## Problem Statement
The current memory collection system in the Claude PM Framework blocks task execution for 2-5 seconds during each memory operation. This creates performance bottlenecks in agent workflows and degrades user experience. The framework needs a fire-and-forget asynchronous memory collection system that operates in the background without blocking agent operations.

## Current State Analysis
Based on codebase analysis:
- **304 async operations** and **279 await calls** in memory services
- Existing SQLite backend with WAL mode and connection pooling
- mem0AI backend with HTTP connection management
- Basic batch processing infrastructure in trigger policies
- Circuit breaker patterns for fault tolerance
- Performance monitoring capabilities

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Asynchronous Queue System
- **Background Queue**: Implement asyncio.Queue-based memory operation queue
- **Fire-and-Forget Interface**: Non-blocking memory collection API
- **Operation Queuing**: Queue memory operations with metadata and retry logic
- **Batch Processing**: Configurable batch sizes and timeout intervals
- **Priority Handling**: High-priority operations (errors, bugs) get precedence

### 2. Performance Optimization
- **Local Caching**: In-memory cache for recently accessed memory items
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimize database connection reuse
- **Batch Operations**: Group similar memory operations for efficiency
- **Timeout Management**: Configurable timeouts with graceful degradation
- **Throttling**: Rate limiting to prevent resource exhaustion

### 3. Reliability Features
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for failed operations
- **Circuit Breaker**: Fail-fast pattern for unhealthy backends
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: SQLite fallback when mem0AI unavailable
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error logging and recovery
- **Health Monitoring**: Service health checks and metrics

### 4. Configuration Management
- **Configurable Parameters**: Batch size, timeout, retry attempts
- **Environment-Based Settings**: Development vs production configs
- **Runtime Tuning**: Dynamic adjustment based on performance metrics
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing synchronous API support

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Async Infrastructure
1. **AsyncMemoryQueue Service**
   - Implement background queue processor

   - TTL-based cache cleanup
   - Cache hit/miss metrics

2. **Batch Processing Enhancement**
   - Optimize batch grouping algorithms
   - Implement smart batching by category
   - Add batch timeout management
   - Configure batch size optimization

### Phase 3: Reliability & Monitoring
1. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive retry logic
   - Circuit breaker implementation
   - Fallback chain optimization
   - Error classification system

2. **Health Monitoring**
   - Queue size monitoring
   - Operation latency tracking
   - Success/failure rate metrics
   - Performance alerting

## Implementation Details

### New Components

#### 1. AsyncMemoryCollector
```python
class AsyncMemoryCollector:
    """
    Fire-and-forget memory collection service.
    Queues operations for background processing.
    """
    
    async def collect_async(
        self,
        category: MemoryCategory,
        content: str,
        metadata: Dict[str, Any],
        priority: str = "medium"
    ) -> None:
        """Non-blocking memory collection."""
        
    async def flush_queue(self) -> None:
        """Force process all queued operations."""
```

#### 2. MemoryOperationQueue
```python
class MemoryOperationQueue:
    """
    Manages queued memory operations with batching and retry.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, config: Dict[str, Any]):
        self.batch_size = config.get("batch_size", 10)
        self.batch_timeout = config.get("batch_timeout", 30)
        self.max_retries = config.get("max_retries", 3)
        self.queue = asyncio.Queue()
```

#### 3. MemoryCache
```python
class MemoryCache:
    """
    Local in-memory cache for frequently accessed memories.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, max_size: int = 1000, ttl: int = 300):
        self.cache = {}  # LRU cache implementation
        self.ttl = ttl
```

### Configuration Schema
```yaml
memory:
  async_collection:
    enabled: true
    batch_size: 10
    batch_timeout: 30
    max_queue_size: 1000
    max_retries: 3
    retry_delay: 1.0
    
  cache:
    enabled: true
    max_size: 1000
    ttl_seconds: 300
    
  performance:
    operation_timeout: 15.0
    max_concurrent_ops: 20
    health_check_interval: 60
