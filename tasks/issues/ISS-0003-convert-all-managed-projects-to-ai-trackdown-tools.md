  # Issue: Convert All Managed Projects to ai-trackdown-tools


  ## Overview

  Systematically migrate all 11+ managed projects from legacy tracking systems to ai-trackdown-tools for unified
  portfolio management.


  ## Implementation Strategy


  ### Phase 2A - Pilot Projects (5 pts)

  - [ ] Select 3 representative pilot projects (diverse tech stacks)

  - [ ] Document project-specific migration requirements

  - [ ] Execute pilot migrations with full validation

  - [ ] Gather feedback and refine migration process


  ### Phase 2B - Batch Migration (11 pts)  

  - [ ] Migrate remaining 8+ managed projects systematically

  - [ ] Ensure project-specific customizations preserved

  - [ ] Validate cross-project task coordination

  - [ ] Update project templates for consistency


  ### Phase 2C - Integration (5 pts)

  - [ ] Health monitoring includes all ai-trackdown projects

  - [ ] mem0AI indexing covers all managed projects

  - [ ] Cross-project task coordination functional

  - [ ] Portfolio dashboard shows unified status


  ## Managed Projects Portfolio


  ### Strategic Projects

  - claude-pm-portfolio-manager

  - mem0ai-oss  

  - ai-power-rankings

  - scraper-engine


  ### Development Projects

  - matsuoka-com

  - hot-flash

  - eva-monorepo

  - ai-code-review


  ### Infrastructure Projects  

  - py-mcp-ipc

  - ai-trackdown-tools

  - Additional projects (11+ total)


  ## Technical Requirements


  ### Migration Process

  - [ ] Standardized migration workflow documentation

  - [ ] Data preservation and validation procedures

  - [ ] Project-specific configuration templates

  - [ ] Rollback procedures for each project type


  ### Integration Validation

  - [ ] Cross-project task visibility verification

  - [ ] Portfolio-wide health monitoring integration

  - [ ] Unified reporting and analytics setup

  - [ ] Team workflow consistency across projects


  ### Quality Assurance

  - [ ] No disruption to active project workflows

  - [ ] All existing project data preserved

  - [ ] Performance benchmarking across portfolio

  - [ ] User acceptance testing for each project team


  ## Acceptance Criteria


  ### Migration Success

  - [ ] All 11+ managed projects successfully converted to ai-trackdown-tools

  - [ ] Zero data loss across all migrations

  - [ ] Consistent workflow patterns across diverse project types

  - [ ] Team training and documentation completed


  ### Portfolio Integration

  - [ ] Unified task management across all managed projects

  - [ ] Cross-project dependency tracking functional

  - [ ] Portfolio dashboard provides comprehensive oversight

  - [ ] Health monitoring covers entire managed portfolio


  ### Business Impact

  - **Portfolio Efficiency**: Unified task management across all managed projects

  - **Strategic Visibility**: Enhanced oversight and coordination capabilities  

  - **Scalability**: Foundation for managing larger project portfolios

  - **Standardization**: Consistent workflows and reporting across diverse projects


  ## Risk Assessment


  **High Risk**:

  - **Portfolio Disruption**: Risk of disrupting multiple active projects simultaneously

  - **Integration Complexity**: Complex integration across diverse project types

  - **Data Migration**: Risk of losing project-specific task history or metadata


  **Mitigation Strategies**:

  - **Phased Rollout**: Gradual conversion starting with strategic projects

  - **Project-Specific Planning**: Customized migration approach per project

  - **Comprehensive Testing**: Full validation before each project conversion

  - **Rollback Capability**: Individual project rollback without portfolio impact


  ## Dependencies

  - **ISS-0001 Success**: Framework pilot must validate approach and integration

  - **ISS-0002 Complete**: Health monitoring must include ai-trackdown-tools

  - **Project Readiness**: Each managed project must be stable for migration

  - **Team Availability**: Sufficient resources for systematic rollout


  ## Notes

  **Priority**: HIGH - Strategic portfolio standardization

  **Phase**: Phase 2 - Post-framework validation

  **Scope**: All managed projects under ~/Projects/managed/

  **Impact**: Foundation for scalable portfolio management
