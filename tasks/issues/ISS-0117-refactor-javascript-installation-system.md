title: Refactor JavaScript Installation System
description: >-
  ## Overview

  Refactor the JavaScript Installation System (2,032 lines across multiple files)
  into platform-specific modules with clear separation between Node.js management,
  package installation, and dependency validation.

  ## Problem Statement:

  The current JavaScript installation system spans multiple large files:
  - Node.js installation and management (600+ lines)
  - Package installation workflows (500+ lines)
  - Dependency validation and resolution (400+ lines)
  - Platform-specific installation logic (300+ lines)
  - Error handling and recovery (232+ lines)

  ## Platform-Specific Architecture:

  **Core Installation Layer:**
  - `install/javascript/node_manager.py` - Node.js version management and installation
  - `install/javascript/package_installer.py` - NPM/Yarn package installation workflows
  - `install/javascript/dependency_resolver.py` - Dependency validation and resolution
  - `install/javascript/version_coordinator.py` - Version compatibility management

  **Platform-Specific Modules:**
  - `install/javascript/platforms/macos_installer.py` - macOS-specific installation logic
  - `install/javascript/platforms/linux_installer.py` - Linux-specific installation logic
  - `install/javascript/platforms/windows_installer.py` - Windows-specific installation logic

  **Validation and Monitoring:**
  - `install/javascript/validation/install_validator.py` - Installation verification
  - `install/javascript/validation/health_monitor.py` - Runtime health monitoring
  - `install/javascript/validation/dependency_checker.py` - Dependency integrity checking

  **Configuration Management:**
  - `install/javascript/config/registry_manager.py` - NPM registry and configuration
  - `install/javascript/config/environment_manager.py` - Environment setup and paths
  - `install/javascript/config/project_detector.py` - Project type detection and setup

  ## Implementation Plan:

  **Phase 1: Core Extraction (Days 1-2)**
  1. Extract Node.js management functionality
  2. Separate package installation workflows
  3. Create dependency resolution service
  4. Implement version coordination system

  **Phase 2: Platform Specialization (Days 2-3)**
  1. Create platform-specific installers
  2. Implement platform detection and abstraction
  3. Extract platform-specific logic from core modules

  **Phase 3: Validation Framework (Days 3-4)**
  1. Create installation validation service
  2. Implement health monitoring system
  3. Create dependency integrity checking

  **Phase 4: Configuration Services (Days 4-5)**
  1. Extract registry and configuration management
  2. Create environment setup service
  3. Implement project detection and setup

  ## Success Criteria:

  - JavaScript installation code reduced from 2,032 lines to <1,200 lines total
  - Each module <200 lines with clear responsibilities
  - Platform-specific logic properly isolated
  - Installation success rate improved by 20%+
  - Error handling and recovery improved
  - Setup time reduced by 25%+

  ## Dependencies:

  - Must maintain compatibility with existing NPM/Node.js installations
  - Platform detection logic must be robust and accurate
  - Error recovery mechanisms must be preserved and improved
  - All package management workflows must remain functional

  ## Testing Requirements:

  - Unit tests for each module component
  - Platform-specific testing on macOS, Linux, Windows
  - Integration tests for complete installation workflows
  - Package installation validation tests
  - Error recovery and rollback testing

  ## Reference:

  Based on codebase analysis identifying JavaScript installation system as fourth
  highest complexity target with significant platform-specific logic.
