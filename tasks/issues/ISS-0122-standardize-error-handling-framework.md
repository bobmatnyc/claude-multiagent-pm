title: Standardize Error Handling Framework
description: >-
  ## Overview

  Standardize error handling across the codebase by replacing 923 broad
  exception handlers with a structured error handling framework that provides
  consistent error classification, recovery strategies, and user feedback.

  ## Problem Statement:

  The current codebase contains 923 broad exception handlers with:
  - Generic try/except blocks without specific error handling
  - Inconsistent error reporting and user feedback
  - No standardized error classification or recovery strategies
  - Missing error context and debugging information
  - Difficult error tracking and analysis

  ## Structured Error Handling Framework:

  **Core Error Framework:**
  - `errors/core/error_manager.py` - Central error management and coordination
  - `errors/core/error_classifier.py` - Error classification and categorization
  - `errors/core/recovery_manager.py` - Error recovery strategies and execution
  - `errors/core/error_reporter.py` - Structured error reporting and feedback

  **Error Types and Classifications:**
  - `errors/types/system_errors.py` - System-level error definitions
  - `errors/types/user_errors.py` - User input and interaction errors
  - `errors/types/network_errors.py` - Network and connectivity errors
  - `errors/types/configuration_errors.py` - Configuration-related errors

  **Recovery Strategies:**
  - `errors/recovery/retry_strategies.py` - Retry mechanisms and backoff strategies
  - `errors/recovery/fallback_handlers.py` - Fallback operations and alternatives
  - `errors/recovery/cleanup_handlers.py` - Resource cleanup and state recovery
  - `errors/recovery/user_guidance.py` - User guidance and resolution suggestions

  **Monitoring and Analysis:**
  - `errors/monitoring/error_tracker.py` - Error tracking and analytics
  - `errors/monitoring/pattern_detector.py` - Error pattern detection
  - `errors/monitoring/alert_manager.py` - Error alerting and notifications

  ## Implementation Plan:

  **Phase 1: Core Framework (Days 1-2)**
  1. Create central error management system
  2. Implement error classification framework
  3. Create structured error reporting
  4. Implement basic recovery strategies

  **Phase 2: Error Type Migration (Days 2-3)**
  1. Define system-level error types
  2. Create user interaction error types
  3. Implement network error handling
  4. Create configuration error types

  **Phase 3: Recovery Implementation (Days 3-4)**
  1. Implement retry strategies and backoff
  2. Create fallback operation handlers
  3. Implement cleanup and state recovery
  4. Create user guidance systems

  **Phase 4: Monitoring and Migration (Day 4)**
  1. Implement error tracking and analytics
  2. Create error pattern detection
  3. Migrate existing broad exception handlers
  4. Validation and testing

  ## Success Criteria:

  - Replace 923 broad handlers with structured error handling
  - All errors properly classified and handled appropriately
  - Error recovery strategies implemented for common failure scenarios
  - User-friendly error messages and guidance provided
  - Error tracking enables pattern analysis and improvement
  - System reliability improved through better error handling

  ## Dependencies:

  - Must maintain system stability during migration
  - All current error scenarios must continue to be handled
  - Error handling performance must not degrade
  - Existing error logging and monitoring must be preserved

  ## Testing Requirements:

  - Unit tests for error handling framework components
  - Error scenario testing for all error types
  - Recovery strategy testing and validation
  - Performance testing for error handling overhead
  - Integration testing with existing error scenarios

  ## Reference:

  Based on codebase analysis identifying 923 broad exception handlers
  as a significant reliability and maintainability issue.
