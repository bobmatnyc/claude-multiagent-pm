title: Resume v0.8.3 publication after subprocess validation protocol implementation
description: >-
  RESUMPTION ISSUE - Critical work continuation after restart


  ## Current State

  - Discovered critical subprocess communication issues where agents reported success but actual functionality was
  broken

  - Added comprehensive subprocess validation protocol to framework CLAUDE.md 

  - Need to resume v0.8.3 publication with proper validation protocols


  ## Critical Issues Discovered

  1. **Missing unified_memory_service import** - Agent reported success but import was missing

  2. **Version detection showing v0.7.5 instead of v0.8.3** - Version system inconsistency  

  3. **Async memory system failures** - Memory system not functioning properly despite success reports

  4. **Subprocess validation gaps** - Agents reporting success without actual validation


  ## Items Requiring Completion

  - [ ] Fix missing unified_memory_service import in affected modules

  - [ ] Fix version detection to properly show v0.8.3 instead of v0.7.5

  - [ ] Resolve async memory system failures and validation

  - [ ] Complete v0.8.3 publication with proper subprocess validation

  - [ ] Implement new subprocess validation protocol from CLAUDE.md


  ## New Framework Requirements

  - Comprehensive subprocess validation protocol added to framework CLAUDE.md

  - All agent operations must now include validation steps

  - Memory collection required for all subprocess operations


  ## Next Steps

  1. Implement subprocess validation protocol

  2. Fix identified technical issues

  3. Complete v0.8.3 publication with proper validation

  4. Validate all subprocess operations are working correctly


  ## Context

  - Date: 2025-07-14

  - Framework: Claude PM v012

  - Publication target: v0.8.3

  - Validation protocol: New comprehensive subprocess validation


  This issue ensures work continuity after restart and addresses critical subprocess validation issues.
