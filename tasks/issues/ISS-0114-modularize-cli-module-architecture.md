title: Modularize CLI Module Architecture
description: >-
  ## Overview

  Refactor the monolithic CLI module (claude_pm/cli.py - 3,817 lines) into a modular
  architecture with specialized components for command handling, service coordination,
  and user interface management.

  ## Problem Statement:

  The current CLI module has grown to 3,817 lines, making it:
  - Difficult to maintain and understand
  - Hard to test individual components
  - Prone to merge conflicts during development
  - Challenging to extend with new commands
  - Complex cyclomatic complexity and coupling

  ## Modularization Strategy:

  **Core Architecture Components:**
  - `cli/core/base_command.py` - Base command interface and common functionality
  - `cli/core/service_manager.py` - Service initialization and coordination
  - `cli/core/context_manager.py` - CLI context and configuration management
  - `cli/core/error_handler.py` - Centralized error handling and user feedback

  **Command Groups:**
  - `cli/commands/agents/` - Agent-related commands (agents, cmpm:agents)
  - `cli/commands/project/` - Project management commands
  - `cli/commands/deployment/` - Deployment and setup commands
  - `cli/commands/health/` - Health monitoring and diagnostics
  - `cli/commands/memory/` - Memory service management
  - `cli/commands/tickets/` - Ticket and tracking commands

  **Support Modules:**
  - `cli/utils/output_formatter.py` - Consistent output formatting
  - `cli/utils/progress_indicator.py` - Progress tracking and display
  - `cli/utils/validation.py` - Input validation and sanitization

  ## Implementation Plan:

  **Phase 1: Core Architecture (Days 1-2)**
  1. Extract base command interface and service manager
  2. Create modular context management system
  3. Implement centralized error handling

  **Phase 2: Command Modularization (Days 3-4)**
  1. Separate command groups into specialized modules
  2. Maintain command registration and discovery
  3. Preserve all existing CLI functionality

  **Phase 3: Integration and Testing (Day 5)**
  1. Integrate modular components
  2. Comprehensive testing of all CLI commands
  3. Performance validation and optimization

  ## Success Criteria:

  - CLI module reduced from 3,817 lines to <500 lines (main entry point)
  - Each command module <300 lines
  - All existing CLI functionality preserved
  - Test coverage increased by 40%+
  - Build time improvement by 15%+
  - Clear separation of concerns achieved

  ## Dependencies:

  - Must maintain compatibility with existing command structure
  - Service initialization patterns must be preserved
  - All Click decorators and command signatures maintained

  ## Testing Requirements:

  - Unit tests for each modular component
  - Integration tests for command registration
  - End-to-end tests for all CLI workflows
  - Performance regression testing

  ## Reference:

  Based on codebase analysis showing CLI module as highest complexity target
  with significant refactoring potential following ISS-0085 modularization patterns.

# Issue: Modularize CLI Module Architecture

## Description
Refactor the monolithic CLI module (claude_pm/cli.py - 3,817 lines) into a modular architecture with specialized components for command handling, service coordination, and user interface management.
