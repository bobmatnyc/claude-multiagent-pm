  # Issue: ai-trackdown-tools Cutover Implementation


  ## Overview

  Strategic cutover from current trackdown system to ai-trackdown-tools for enhanced task management capabilities. This
  represents a fundamental infrastructure upgrade that will improve project management efficiency across all managed
  projects.


  ## Implementation Strategy

  1. **Phase 1 - Framework Cutover**: Convert claude-multiagent-pm task management to ai-trackdown-tools

  2. **Phase 2 - Managed Projects**: On successful validation, roll out to all 11+ managed projects  

  3. **Phase 3 - Integration**: Ensure seamless integration with existing mem0AI and health monitoring


  ## Core Benefits

  - **Enhanced Task Management**: Superior tracking, prioritization, and reporting capabilities

  - **Unified Interface**: Consistent task management across all managed projects

  - **Integration Ready**: Better integration with mem0AI memory systems

  - **Scalability**: Support for growing number of managed projects

  - **Analytics**: Improved project velocity and completion metrics


  ## Acceptance Criteria


  ### Phase 1 - Framework Migration

  - [x] All 42+ claude-multiagent-pm tickets migrated to ai-trackdown-tools format

  - [x] Project structure initialized with proper epic organization

  - [ ] No data loss during migration process - validate all ticket data preserved

  - [ ] All existing automation scripts updated and functional

  - [ ] Health monitoring includes ai-trackdown-tools status checks

  - [ ] Documentation updated to reflect new task management system

  - [ ] Team workflow validation completed


  ### Phase 2 - Managed Projects

  - [ ] Migration process documented and standardized

  - [ ] At least 3 pilot managed projects successfully migrated

  - [ ] Template updates completed for new project onboarding

  - [ ] Cross-project task visibility and coordination verified


  ## Technical Requirements


  ### Framework Integration

  - [x] Convert current claude-multiagent-pm tickets (42 active) to ai-trackdown-tools format

  - [ ] Preserve all ticket history, status, and metadata during migration

  - [ ] Ensure backward compatibility with existing automation and scripts

  - [ ] Update health monitoring (M01-044) to include ai-trackdown-tools status

  - [ ] Integrate with mem0AI for enhanced context and memory capabilities


  ### Quality Assurance  

  - [ ] Comprehensive testing of migration process on test project

  - [ ] Validation of all existing functionality post-migration

  - [ ] Performance benchmarking to ensure no degradation

  - [ ] Rollback plan in case of migration issues


  ## Risk Assessment


  **High Risk**:

  - Portfolio Disruption: Risk of disrupting multiple active projects simultaneously

  - Integration Complexity: Complex integration across diverse project types


  **Mitigation Strategies**:

  - Phased Rollout: Gradual conversion starting with strategic projects

  - Comprehensive Testing: Full validation before each project conversion

  - Rollback Capability: Individual project rollback without portfolio impact


  ## Notes

  **Status**: 50% Complete - Initial migration structure created, CLI operational, data migration in progress.

  **Next Steps**: Complete ticket data migration and validate system functionality.
