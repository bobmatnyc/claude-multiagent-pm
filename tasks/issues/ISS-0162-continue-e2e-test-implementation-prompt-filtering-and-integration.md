title: Continue E2E Test Implementation - Prompt Filtering and Integration
description: >-
  Continue implementation of E2E testing framework for the refactored orchestration system.


  ## Current Status


  - âœ… E2E test infrastructure set up

  - âœ… Agent discovery tests implemented

  - âœ… Agent selection tests implemented  

  - âœ… Process management tests implemented

  - âœ… LOCAL orchestration tests implemented

  - âœ… Prompt generation tests implemented

  - ðŸ”„ Prompt filtering tests - IN PROGRESS (needs completion)


  ## Next Steps


  1. Complete test_prompt_filtering.py implementation

  2. Create test_context_management.py for context handling

  3. Run all E2E tests to verify coverage

  4. Update test documentation

  5. Create integration test suite that combines all components

  6. Generate coverage report


  ## Code Locations


  - Tests: tests/e2e/core/

  - Test infrastructure: tests/e2e/utils/

  - Fixtures: tests/e2e/fixtures/


  ## Deployment Status


  - Local deployment completed via scripts/deploy_scripts.py

  - Framework version: 014

  - All EP-0043 refactored modules included


  ## Technical Context


  The E2E testing framework validates the complete orchestration flow from agent discovery through prompt generation and
  subprocess execution. The remaining work focuses on completing the prompt filtering logic and creating comprehensive
  integration tests.


  ## Success Criteria


  - All E2E tests passing

  - Code coverage > 80% for orchestration modules

  - Integration tests demonstrate full orchestration workflow

  - Documentation updated with testing guidelines

### QA Agent Testing Update (2025-07-20)
QA Agent (TSK-0032): Test of updated ticketing workflow completed successfully. The new PM ticketing workflow where PM creates tickets directly using aitrackdown has been validated. Test results available in /Users/masa/Projects/claude-multiagent-pm/test_ticketing_workflow.md

#### Key Findings:
- Direct ticket creation by PM using aitrackdown works successfully
- Task TSK-0032 created and properly linked to ISS-0162
- Comments can only be added at issue level, not task level
- State transitions work correctly (planning â†’ ready_for_engineering)
