# Refactor health_monitor.py (1,482 lines)

**Issue ID**: ISS-0158  
**Epic**: EP-0043  
**Status**: open  
**Priority**: medium  
**Created**: 2025-07-18  
**Updated**: 2025-07-18  
**Estimated Effort**: 3 days  
**Tags**: refactoring, maintainability, medium-priority

## Summary
Refactor the health_monitor.py service to reduce its size from 1,482 lines to multiple focused modules, improving maintainability and monitoring capabilities.

## Current State
- **File**: `claude_pm/services/health_monitor.py`
- **Current Size**: 1,482 lines
- **Complexity**: Comprehensive health monitoring including:
  - System health checks
  - Agent health validation
  - Performance monitoring
  - Resource tracking
  - Alert generation
  - Diagnostic reporting

## Proposed Refactoring

### Module Split Strategy
1. **health_monitor.py** (~300 lines)
   - Core HealthMonitor class
   - Public API and orchestration
   - High-level health status
   
2. **system_checks.py** (~300 lines)
   - System-level health checks
   - Resource monitoring (CPU, memory, disk)
   - Process validation
   
3. **agent_health.py** (~250 lines)
   - Agent-specific health checks
   - Agent availability monitoring
   - Agent performance tracking
   
4. **diagnostics.py** (~300 lines)
   - Diagnostic data collection
   - Health report generation
   - Troubleshooting information
   
5. **alerts.py** (~200 lines)
   - Alert threshold management
   - Alert generation and routing
   - Notification handling
   
6. **metrics.py** (~150 lines)
   - Performance metrics collection
   - Statistical analysis
   - Trend tracking

### Dependencies to Consider
- Used by CLI for health commands
- Integrated with monitoring dashboard
- Referenced by system initialization
- Critical for operational visibility

### Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1**: Define health check interfaces
2. **Phase 2**: Extract system-level checks
3. **Phase 3**: Separate agent health monitoring
4. **Phase 4**: Modularize diagnostics and alerts
5. **Phase 5**: Integration testing

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for each health module
- [ ] Integration tests for complete health checks
- [ ] Performance impact testing
- [ ] Alert generation testing
- [ ] Mock failure scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] No file exceeds 1000 lines
- [ ] All health checks functioning
- [ ] No false positives/negatives
- [ ] Performance overhead < 1%
- [ ] Diagnostic quality maintained
- [ ] Alert accuracy preserved

## Risk Assessment
- **Medium Risk**: Health monitoring is critical for operations
- **Mitigation**: Parallel run old/new systems during transition

## Documentation Updates Required
- [ ] Health check catalog
- [ ] Alert threshold documentation
- [ ] Diagnostic interpretation guide
- [ ] Module interaction diagrams

## Notes
- Consider adding new health checks during refactoring
- Opportunity to improve performance monitoring
- Coordinate with DevOps for monitoring integration
