# Branch Protection Configuration

## ISS-0074 Feature Branch Protection

### Branch: `feature/ISS-0074-session-cleanup-fixes`

#### Protection Rules
- **Require pull request reviews**: 1 required reviewer
- **Dismiss stale reviews**: Enabled when new commits are pushed
- **Require review from code owners**: Enabled
- **Restrict pushes**: Only allow squash merging
- **Require status checks**: All CI checks must pass
- **Require up-to-date branches**: Branch must be up to date before merging

#### Required Status Checks
1. **Session Cleanup Validation** (`session-cleanup-validation`)
   - Connection leak detection tests
   - aiohttp session cleanup validation
   - Framework services health check
   - Memory service session validation
   - Performance regression tests
   - Session leak detection

2. **Integration Tests** (`integration-tests`)
   - Memory fixes validation
   - Hierarchical agent system tests
   - Claude PM memory integration tests
   - Health monitoring system validation
   - Framework services reliability tests (≥75% success rate)

3. **Deployment Readiness** (`deployment-readiness`)
   - Version compatibility checks
   - Configuration validation
   - Service registry tests
   - Deployment report generation

#### Merge Strategy

##### Three-Phase Implementation Approach
1. **Phase 1 - Immediate Fixes** (Target: Week 1)
   - Critical session cleanup in `framework_services.py`
   - Memory service connection management
   - Basic connection manager implementation

2. **Phase 2 - ServiceRegistry Enhancement** (Target: Week 2)
   - Enhanced service lifecycle management
   - Centralized session management
   - Improved error handling and recovery

3. **Phase 3 - Enhanced Monitoring** (Target: Week 3)
   - Advanced health monitoring capabilities
   - Performance metrics and alerting
   - Comprehensive session tracking

##### Merge Requirements
- All CI/CD pipeline checks must pass
- Code coverage must maintain or improve current levels
- Performance regression tests must show no degradation
- Session leak detection must show zero leaks
- Framework reliability must be ≥75% (target: 100%)

##### Success Metrics Validation
- **Reliability**: 75% → 100% success rate
- **Session Management**: Zero leaked aiohttp sessions
- **Performance**: No regression in response times
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation under failure conditions

#### Code Review Guidelines

##### Focus Areas
1. **Session Management**
   - Proper session creation and cleanup patterns
   - Context manager usage for resource management
   - Exception handling for connection failures

2. **Performance Impact**
   - Memory usage patterns
   - Connection pooling efficiency
   - Async/await patterns and error propagation

3. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful degradation mechanisms
   - Circuit breaker patterns
   - Retry logic and backoff strategies

4. **Testing Coverage**
   - Unit tests for session management
   - Integration tests for service interactions
   - Performance benchmarks and leak detection

##### Approval Criteria
- Code follows established patterns and conventions
- All automated tests pass with adequate coverage
- Performance benchmarks meet or exceed targets
- Documentation is updated appropriately
- Security considerations are addressed

#### Release Coordination

##### Version Target: 4.5.2
- Feature branch aligns with framework versioning
- Coordinate with existing release cycle
- Ensure backward compatibility maintained
- Update changelog and release notes

##### Timeline
- **Development**: 2-3 weeks (3-phase approach)
- **Testing**: Continuous integration during development
- **Code Review**: 2-3 days for thorough review
- **Merge**: Once all protection rules satisfied
- **Release**: Coordinate with framework release schedule

#### Documentation Requirements
- Update technical specifications with implementation details
- Enhance troubleshooting guides with session management
- Add performance monitoring documentation
- Update architectural decision records (ADRs)

#### Monitoring and Validation
- Continuous monitoring of CI/CD pipeline health
- Weekly progress reviews and milestone validation
- Performance regression tracking and alerting
- Session leak monitoring in production environments

## Emergency Procedures

### Hotfix Protocol
If critical session management issues are discovered:
1. Create hotfix branch from main: `hotfix/ISS-0074-critical-session-fix`
2. Apply minimal necessary changes
3. Fast-track through abbreviated CI/CD pipeline
4. Emergency review and merge approval
5. Immediate deployment and monitoring

### Rollback Strategy
If deployment causes issues:
1. Immediate rollback to previous stable version
2. Issue analysis and root cause identification
3. Fix development in feature branch
4. Re-validation through full CI/CD pipeline
5. Coordinated re-deployment with enhanced monitoring

This branch protection configuration ensures high-quality, well-tested implementation of ISS-0074 session cleanup fixes while maintaining framework stability and performance standards.
