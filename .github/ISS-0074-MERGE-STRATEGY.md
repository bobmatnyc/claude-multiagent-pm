   - Performance regression testing
   - Integration test suite
   - Coverage reporting and analysis

3. **Deployment Readiness**
   - Version compatibility verification
   - Configuration validation
   - Service registry testing
   - Release artifact generation

### Quality Gates
- **Code Coverage**: Maintain â‰¥85% coverage
- **Performance**: No regression in response times
- **Reliability**: â‰¥75% success rate (target: 100%)
- **Security**: No new security vulnerabilities
- **Documentation**: All changes documented

   - API documentation updates
   - Troubleshooting guide enhancements

3. **Deployment Coordination**
   - Production deployment planning
   - Monitoring alert configuration
   - Performance baseline establishment

## Risk Management

### Potential Risks
1. **Session Management Complexity**
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing and validation
   - **Rollback**: Feature flag for legacy session management

2. **Performance Regression**
   - **Mitigation**: Continuous performance monitoring
   - **Rollback**: Immediate revert capability with monitoring

3. **Integration Issues**
   - **Mitigation**: Extensive integration testing
   - **Rollback**: Service-level rollback with graceful degradation

### Rollback Strategy
1. **Immediate Rollback**
   - Revert merge commit on main branch
   - Deploy previous stable version (v4.5.1)
   - Activate monitoring for stability validation

2. **Feature Flag Rollback**
   - Disable new session management via configuration
   - Fall back to legacy session handling
   - Maintain monitoring and logging

3. **Service-Level Rollback**
   - Individual service rollback capability
   - Maintain core framework functionality
   - Isolated issue resolution
