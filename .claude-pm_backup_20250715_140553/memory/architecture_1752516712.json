    "description": "Successfully reorganized agent hierarchy into three-tier system with 10 core system agents and 6 project-specific agents.",
    "achievements": [
      "Created 10 core system agents: Documentation, Ticketing, Version Control, QA, Research, Ops, Security, Engineer, Data Engineer, Architect",
      "Moved 6 non-core agents to project-specific tier: Orchestrator, Integration, Code Review, Performance, UI/UX, Data",
      "Agent hierarchy validation passes with 100% success rate",
      "Hierarchical agent loader successfully discovers all agents",
      "Three-tier precedence system working correctly: Project \u2192 User \u2192 System"
