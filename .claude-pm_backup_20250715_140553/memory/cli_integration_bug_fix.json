Root cause: NPM package installation did not include Python package installation step, causing ModuleNotFoundError when running claude-pm CLI from directories outside framework. Solution: Enhanced postinstall-minimal.js to include Python package installation with --break-system-packages fallback, added CLI fallback mechanisms for automatic package installation, updated package.json scripts. Fixed affects fresh installations and Homebrew Python environments.",
