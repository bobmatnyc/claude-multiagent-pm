# Sample Design Document - Task Management Web App

## Project Overview
We need to build a modern task management web application that allows users to create, organize, and track their tasks and projects. The application should have a clean, intuitive interface and support real-time collaboration features.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Create, read, update, and delete tasks
- Organize tasks into projects and categories
- Set due dates and priorities for tasks
- Real-time collaboration between team members
- Search and filter functionality
- Dashboard with project overview
- Mobile-responsive design

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Must support 1000+ concurrent users
- Response time under 200ms for basic operations
- Should be scalable and maintainable
- Must work across modern web browsers
- Should follow accessibility best practices

## Technical Constraints
- Must use TypeScript for type safety
- Should use React-based framework for frontend
- Must implement proper error handling
- Should have comprehensive test coverage
