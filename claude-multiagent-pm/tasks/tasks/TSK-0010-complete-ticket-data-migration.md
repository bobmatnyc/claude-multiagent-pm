# Task: Complete Ticket Data Migration

## Description
Complete migration of all legacy trackdown tickets to ai-trackdown-tools format with zero data loss. Currently making significant progress with proper file format understanding.

## Steps
1. [x] Analyze backup data structure
2. [x] Create core epics in ai-trackdown-tools
3. [x] Understand correct file format for ai-trackdown-tools
4. [x] Create critical infrastructure issue (ISS-0010)
5. [ ] Create remaining critical Phase 1 issues
6. [ ] Create completed tickets with proper status
7. [ ] Validate all relationships and dependencies
8. [ ] Update cross-references and epic assignments

## Current Status
- **Progress**: 65% complete (improved from 60%)
- **Backup Location**: `/Users/masa/Projects/claude-multiagent-pm/backups/trackdown_backup_20250708_113235/`
- **Epics Created**: âœ… 7 core epics established
- **Issues Created**: âœ… 2 issues (ISS-0001, ISS-0010)
- **Format Understanding**: âœ… CLI format requirements understood
- **Migration Strategy**: âœ… Copy-and-modify approach working

## Critical Phase 1 Tickets to Migrate
- **MEM-001**: Core mem0AI Integration Setup (8 pts) - CRITICAL âœ… Ready for creation
- **MEM-002**: Memory Schema Design (5 pts) - HIGH âœ… Ready for creation
- **MEM-003**: Enhanced Multi-Agent Architecture (13 pts) - HIGH âœ… Ready for creation
- **MEM-004**: Memory-Driven Context Management (8 pts) - HIGH
- **MEM-005**: Intelligent Task Decomposition (8 pts) - MEDIUM
- **MEM-006**: Continuous Learning Engine (10 pts) - MEDIUM
- **MEM-007**: Intelligent Project Memory Indexing System (13 pts) - HIGH
- **TRK-001**: ai-trackdown-tools Cutover Implementation (8 pts) - STRATEGIC HIGH âœ… CREATED as ISS-0010
- **TRK-002**: Convert All Managed Projects to ai-trackdown-tools (21 pts) - STRATEGIC HIGH
- **FRW-009**: Complete LangGraph Removal & System Cleanup (8 pts) - HIGH
- **DEP-001**: Universal Deployment & Extensibility Framework (21 pts) - HIGH
- **M01-044**: Comprehensive Health Slash Command (5 pts) - HIGH

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Understand ai-trackdown-tools file format requirements
- [x] Create core infrastructure issue successfully
- [ ] All 42+ tickets from backup represented in ai-trackdown-tools
- [ ] All story points and priority levels preserved
- [ ] All epic assignments and relationships maintained
- [ ] All completed tickets marked with proper status
- [ ] All dependencies and cross-references updated
- [ ] Zero data loss during migration

## Migration Strategy
1. **Epic Creation**: âœ… COMPLETED - 7 core epics created
2. **Format Understanding**: âœ… COMPLETED - CLI format requirements understood
3. **Critical Issues**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS - Using copy-and-modify approach
4. **Remaining Tickets**: Create all remaining tickets with proper relationships
5. **Status Updates**: Update completion percentages and status
6. **Validation**: Ensure all tickets are present and properly configured

## Notes
Breakthrough achieved in understanding ai-trackdown-tools file format. The CLI requires specific frontmatter fields and the copy-and-modify approach is working well. Ready to accelerate migration of remaining tickets.
