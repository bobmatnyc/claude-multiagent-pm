# Issue: Comprehensive Health Slash Command for All Subsystems

## Description
Create `/health` slash command as unified health dashboard with real-time status display, color-coded indicators, and comprehensive subsystem monitoring.

## Scope
- Create `/health` slash command as unified health dashboard
- Integrate all subsystem health checks in single command
- Real-time status display with color-coded indicators
- Support for detailed subsystem breakdown and alerts
- Integration with existing health monitoring service

## Subsystems to Monitor
- **Framework Services**: health_monitor, memory_service, project_service
- **External Dependencies**: mem0AI service (port 8002), git repositories
- **Managed Projects**: 11 managed projects compliance and status
- **Memory Systems**: mem0AI integration, memory retrieval performance
- **Multi-Agent Ecosystem**: Agent availability, parallel execution capacity
- **ai-trackdown-tools**: Task management system status

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `/health` command shows unified dashboard of all subsystem statuses
- [x] Color-coded status indicators implemented
- [x] Real-time health data with last update timestamps
- [x] Detailed breakdown available with `--verbose` flag
- [x] Integration with existing HealthMonitorService
- [x] Support for `--format` options (summary, detailed, json)
- [x] Alert summary showing critical issues
- [x] Performance metrics for response time and system load
- [ ] ai-trackdown-tools health monitoring integration
- [ ] Automated issue detection and alerting

## Current Status
- **Progress**: 80% complete
- **Core Implementation**: âœ… Completed
- **Integration Needed**: ai-trackdown-tools health monitoring
- **Story Points**: 5

## Implementation Files
- **CLI Integration**: `/Users/masa/Projects/claude-multiagent-pm/claude_pm/cli.py`
- **Health Service**: `/Users/masa/Projects/claude-multiagent-pm/claude_pm/services/health_monitor.py`
- **Health Dashboard**: `/Users/masa/Projects/claude-multiagent-pm/claude_pm/services/health_dashboard.py`

## Notes
This issue is critical for maintaining system reliability and providing operational visibility across all framework components.
