# Issue: Core mem0AI Integration Setup

## Description
Implement zero-configuration mem0AI integration with universal memory access across all managed projects, including environment-based configuration and comprehensive test suite.

## Scope
- Environment-based configuration with automatic defaults (no API key setup required)
- ClaudePMMemory class with production-ready features
- Universal memory access across all Claude instances
- Memory categories (Project, Pattern, Team, Error) with enterprise schemas
- Comprehensive test suite with performance validation

## Achievement Highlights
- **Zero-configuration deployment**: No setup required for new projects
- **Universal integration**: Works across all 11 managed projects
- **Performance excellence**: <100ms memory retrieval achieved
- **Enterprise-ready**: Production-grade error handling and validation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Zero-configuration mem0AI integration operational
- [x] Universal memory access working across all managed projects
- [x] Memory categories implemented with proper schemas
- [x] Performance targets achieved (<100ms retrieval)
- [x] Comprehensive test suite passing
- [x] Production-ready error handling
- [x] Documentation completed

## Completion Status
âœ… **COMPLETED** (2025-07-07) - Story Points: 8

## Implementation Files
- **Core Memory Service**: `/Users/masa/Projects/claude-multiagent-pm/claude_pm/services/claude_pm_memory.py`
- **Integration Layer**: `/Users/masa/Projects/claude-multiagent-pm/claude_pm/integrations/mem0ai_integration.py`
- **Test Suite**: `/Users/masa/Projects/claude-multiagent-pm/tests/test_claude_pm_memory.py`

## Notes
This was a critical foundation ticket that enabled all subsequent memory-augmented features. The zero-configuration approach significantly reduced deployment complexity.
