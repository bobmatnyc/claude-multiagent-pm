# Agent Node Architecture - LGR-002 Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the complete agent node architecture for LGR-002 Agent Node Implementation Framework. The architecture provides a foundation for multi-agent orchestration with memory integration, parallel execution support, and standardized interfaces.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Base Agent Node Foundation

## Integration Architecture

### Memory Integration (mem0AI)

```python
# Memory Categories by Agent Role
MEMORY_CATEGORIES = {
    "code_review": ["PATTERN", "TEAM", "ERROR"],
    "orchestrator": ["WORKFLOW", "ASSIGNMENT", "COMPLEXITY"], 
    "architect": ["DESIGN", "API", "INTEGRATION"],
    "engineer": ["IMPLEMENTATION", "TDD", "OPTIMIZATION"],
    "qa": ["TESTING", "QUALITY", "COVERAGE"],
    "researcher": ["ANALYSIS", "EVALUATION", "TRENDS"]
}
```

### State Management Integration

```python
# State Flow Between Agents
TaskState -> OrchestratorNode -> {
    architect_results: ArchitectNode,
    engineer_results: EngineerNode, 
    qa_results: QANode,
    research_results: ResearcherNode,
    code_review_results: CodeReviewNode
}
```

### Parallel Execution Integration

```python
# Agent Execution Groups
PARALLEL_GROUPS = {
    "design_phase": ["ArchitectNode"],
    "implementation_phase": ["EngineerNode"], 
    "validation_phase": ["QANode", "CodeReviewNode"],
    "research_phase": ["ResearcherNode"]  # Can run parallel with any phase
