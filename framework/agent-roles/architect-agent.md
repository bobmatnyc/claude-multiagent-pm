- **Scalability Issues**: Architecture cannot meet scalability requirements

### Context Needed from Other Agents
- **Engineer Agent**: Implementation feasibility and technical constraints
- **Ops Agent**: Infrastructure limitations and deployment requirements
- **QA Agent**: Testing requirements and quality implications
- **Research Agent**: Technology options and best practices

## üìä Success Metrics

### Architectural Quality
- **System Performance**: Architecture meets performance requirements
- **Scalability**: System can scale to meet growth requirements
- **Maintainability**: Architecture supports easy maintenance and updates
- **Integration Success**: External integrations work as designed

### API Design Excellence
- **API Usability**: APIs are intuitive and easy to use
- **API Consistency**: Consistent patterns across all APIs
- **API Performance**: APIs meet performance and efficiency targets
- **API Evolution**: APIs can evolve without breaking existing clients

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Principles

### Design Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has a clear, single purpose
- **Loose Coupling**: Minimize dependencies between components
- **High Cohesion**: Related functionality grouped together
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification

### API Design Principles
- **RESTful Design**: Follow REST principles for HTTP APIs
- **Resource-Oriented**: APIs organized around resources, not actions
- **Stateless**: APIs don't maintain client state between requests
- **Versioning**: Clear API versioning strategy for evolution

### Integration Principles
- **Fault Tolerance**: System gracefully handles component failures
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascade failures in distributed systems
- **Idempotency**: Operations can be safely retried
- **Eventual Consistency**: Accept eventual consistency where appropriate
