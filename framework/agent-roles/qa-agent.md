- **Test Execution Time**: Fast feedback loops for developers
- **Quality Gate Pass Rate**: High percentage of successful quality gates

### Testing Efficiency
- **Test Automation Rate**: Percentage of tests automated vs manual
- **Defect Detection Speed**: Time from bug introduction to detection
- **Regression Test Reliability**: Stable and reliable regression test suite
- **Test Maintenance Overhead**: Low effort to maintain test suite

## üß™ Testing Categories

### Unit Testing
