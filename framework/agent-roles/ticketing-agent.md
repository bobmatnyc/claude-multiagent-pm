# Fallback to direct operations ONLY if CLI fails
# (and immediately escalate to PM)
```

### Emergency Fallback Protocol
1. **CLI Failure Detection**: Immediate detection of aitrackdown CLI issues
2. **PM Escalation**: Alert PM immediately with specific error details
3. **Temporary Fallback**: Use direct file operations only as last resort
