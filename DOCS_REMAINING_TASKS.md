# Documentation Cleanup - Remaining Tasks

**Date**: 2025-07-14  
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete, Phase 2 Identified  
**Priority**: Medium (cleanup foundation complete)

## âœ… Phase 1: COMPLETED
- [x] Move 32 documents to organized archive structure
- [x] Create comprehensive archive documentation  
- [x] Update main README.md for current focus
- [x] Preserve git history through proper mv commands
- [x] Create detailed movement rationale documentation

## ðŸ”„ Phase 2: IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### High Priority
1. **INDEX.md Update** 
   - **Issue**: Contains broken links to moved documents
   - **Action**: Update links and streamline navigation
   - **Impact**: Main navigation hub needs to reflect cleanup

2. **Link Validation**
   - **Issue**: Various broken internal links throughout documentation
   - **Action**: Run comprehensive link validation
   - **Tool**: Use existing `validate_documentation_links.py`

### Medium Priority  
3. **User Guide Promotion**
   - **Issue**: user-guide/ may not be prominently featured
   - **Action**: Ensure clear pathway to user guide from main navigation
   - **Impact**: Primary user documentation should be discoverable

4. **Archive Access Verification**
   - **Issue**: Need to verify archived content remains accessible
   - **Action**: Test archive navigation and document discoverability
   - **Impact**: Historical content should remain useful

## ðŸ“‹ Documentation Gaps Identified

### Navigation Issues
- **INDEX.md Complexity**: May still be too complex for cleaned structure
- **Reference Inconsistency**: Some references may point to moved content
- **User Pathway Clarity**: Need clear pathways for different user types

### Content Organization
- **Essential vs Reference**: Some documents in main dirs may be candidates for archive
- **Duplication Check**: Verify no essential information was lost in moves
- **Version Currency**: Ensure remaining docs reflect current framework version (0.7.0)

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria for Phase 2

### Link Integrity
- [ ] All internal links functional
- [ ] No broken references in INDEX.md  
- [ ] Clear navigation pathways working

### User Experience
- [ ] New users can find getting started information quickly
- [ ] Developers can access technical documentation efficiently  
- [ ] Administrators can find operational guidance easily
- [ ] Historical content accessible when needed

### Content Quality
- [ ] Current documentation reflects v0.7.0 capabilities
- [ ] No essential information missing from main docs
- [ ] Archive content properly categorized and documented

## ðŸ’¡ Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Focus on INDEX.md**: This is the main navigation hub and highest priority
2. **Use Validation Tools**: Leverage existing link validation tools
3. **Test User Journeys**: Verify navigation works for different user types

### Future Maintenance
1. **Regular Link Validation**: Include in documentation maintenance routine
2. **Archive Monitoring**: Track which archived content is accessed most
3. **Content Lifecycle**: Establish process for future content archival
