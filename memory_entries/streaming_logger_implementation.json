  "content": "Successfully implemented single-line ticker display for INFO messages during claude-pm initialization. Key improvements: (1) Modified PostInstallationManager to use setup_streaming_logger() for clean INFO display during initialization, (2) Updated PMAgent to use streaming logger with dual logger approach - streaming for INFO, standard for ERROR/WARNING, (3) Added finalize_streaming_logs() calls to ensure final messages remain visible, (4) Verified implementation with test showing INFO messages overwrite on same line while preserving ERROR/WARNING on separate lines. This resolves the visual clutter issue during framework initialization by using carriage return (\\r) to overwrite current line instead of creating new lines for progress indicators.",
